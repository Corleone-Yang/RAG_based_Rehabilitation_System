    "content": [
      "Warning Signs of Cerebral Infarction: 1. Plaque buildup of the arteries (atherosclerosis): Symptoms: dizziness, tinnitus, chest tightness, and breathing difficulty. Action: Atherosclerosis screening should be done as soon as these symptoms present.",
      "2. Tongue stiffness: Symptoms: stammering, dysfluent speech, easy choking when eating, difficulty in swallowing, and drooling. Action: Seek immediate medical attention if these symptoms occur.",
      "Daily Routine and Behavioral Advice: 1. Avoid jumping right out of bed in the morning: Reason: Blood circulation slows during sleep; some warm-up time helps activate blood flow throughout the body.",
      "2. Have a glass of warm water after getting up: Benefits: Relieves dry mouth and nose, quenches thirst, dilutes blood to promote circulation, moisturizes intestines, relaxes bowels, enlarges blood vessels, lessens blood clot formation, and lowers the risk of myocardial infarction and cerebral infarction. Specifics: Drink 200 ml of plain water, not coffee or tea. Water should be around 104 degrees Fahrenheit.",
      "3. Bowel movement first thing in the morning: Advice: Relax and avoid straining to prevent increased blood pressure and risk of cerebral infarction. Drink a glass of warm water before heading to the bathroom.",
      "4. Avoid irritating foods in the morning: Foods to avoid: Alcohol, chili, and pepper. Reason: These foods stimulate taste buds, cause blood vessel contraction, increase blood pressure, and can trigger cerebral infarction.",
      "5. Avoid high salt and deep-fried foods after the age of 40: Reason: High sodium levels and trans-unsaturated fatty acids from deep-fried foods can trigger atherosclerosis, increasing the risk of cerebral infarction."

      "What is an ischemic stroke? An ischemic stroke occurs when blood flow to part of your brain is blocked. The block is usually caused by a blood clot that gets stuck in a narrow blood vessel. When oxygen cannot get to an area of the brain, tissue in that area may get damaged. The damage can cause loss of body functions controlled by that area of the brain. A stroke is a medical emergency that needs immediate treatment. Most medicines and treatments work best the sooner they are given.",
      "Warning Signs of a Stroke: The words BE FAST can help you remember and recognize warning signs of a stroke: B = Balance: Sudden loss of balance E = Eyes: Loss of vision in one or both eyes F = Face: Face droops on one side A = Arms: Arm drops when both arms are raised S = Speech: Speech is slurred or sounds different T = Time: Time to get help immediately.",
      "Signs and Symptoms of an Ischemic Stroke: Severe headache Loss of vision in one or both eyes Numbness, tingling, weakness, or paralysis on one side of your body Trouble walking or speaking Dizziness, confusion, or fainting.",
      "Risk Factors for Ischemic Stroke: Age 55 or older Family history of stroke, or personal history of transient ischemic attack (TIA) Obesity or lack of physical activity High cholesterol, high blood pressure, or diabetes Smoking cigarettes or using illegal drugs Heart conditions such as atrial fibrillation, recent heart attack, or valve disease Blood clotting disorders, such as Factor V Leiden Oral birth control pills or hormone replacement therapy in women.",
      "Diagnosis and Treatment of Ischemic Stroke: Blood tests to check overall health and clotting ability CT or MRI scans to show where the stroke happened and any brain damage Arteriography to look for blood flow blockage.",
      "Management and Prevention Post-Stroke: Medicines to break apart clots or prevent them from forming, and to treat conditions that increase stroke risk Surgery to remove clots or widen arteries.",
      "Rehabilitation: Go to stroke rehabilitation (rehab) if directed. Specialists include physical, occupational, and speech therapists. Wear pressure stockings as directed to keep blood from pooling in leg veins.",
      "Home Safety and Fall Prevention: Make home safe by removing tripping hazards, taping down electrical cords, keeping paths clear, and ensuring good lighting. Use nonslip materials in slippery areas like bathtubs or shower floors. Use a cane or walker to help maintain balance while walking.",
      "Diet and Exercise: Eat a variety of healthy foods including whole grains, low-fat dairy, beans, lean meats, fish, and at least 5 servings of fruits and vegetables each day. Avoid high-fat, high-cholesterol, high-salt, and high-sugar foods. Maintain a healthy weight and exercise regularly as directed.",
      "Managing Stress and Depression: Manage stress through relaxation techniques like deep breathing or listening to music. Seek help for depression and consider joining support groups for stroke survivors.",
      "Emergency Response: Call emergency services immediately if experiencing signs of a stroke such as facial drooping, arm weakness, confusion, difficulty speaking, severe headache, or vision loss. Seek immediate care for symptoms such as warm, tender, painful limbs, loss of balance or coordination, double vision, or unusual bleeding."

      "Post-Stroke Management: Treatment will be based on a plan of care created by you and your healthcare providers. The plan may include any of the following:",
      "Thrombolytics: Help break apart clots. A medicine called tissue Plasminogen Activator (tPA) may be used to dissolve clots. tPA works best if given within 3 hours of an ischemic stroke. It can improve recovery within 3 months, but it can increase the risk for brain bleeding or other life-threatening health problems. Your healthcare provider will talk to you or family members about all risks and benefits of tPA.",
      "Antiplatelets: Such as aspirin, help prevent blood clots. Take your antiplatelet medicine exactly as directed. These medicines make it more likely for you to bleed or bruise. If you are told to take aspirin, do not take acetaminophen or ibuprofen instead.",

      "Medicines: May be given to treat other health conditions such as high cholesterol, high blood pressure, or diabetes.",
      "Surgery: May be needed to remove the clot. You may also need surgery to widen arteries or to place a filter into a blood vessel. This surgery helps to improve blood flow and prevent clots.",
      "Recovery Testing: Your healthcare provider will test your recovery 90 days (3 months) after your stroke. This may be done over the phone or in person. Your provider will ask how well you can do the activities you did before the stroke. He or she will also ask how well you can do your daily activities without help. Your provider may make recommendations for you based on your test. For example, you may need someone to help you walk safely. You may also need help with daily activities, such as getting dressed. Based on your answers, your provider may do this test again over time.",
      "Rehabilitation: Go to stroke rehabilitation (rehab) if directed. Rehab is a program run by specialists who will help you recover abilities you may have lost. Specialists include physical, occupational, and speech therapists. Physical therapists help you gain strength or keep your balance. Occupational therapists teach you new ways to do daily activities, such as getting dressed. Your therapy may include movements for everyday activities. An example is being able to raise yourself from a chair. A speech therapist helps you improve your ability to talk and swallow. You may also be shown ways to manage a medical condition that increases the risk for a stroke. Examples include diabetes, high blood pressure, or a heart condition.",

      "IV: You may need an IV to give you medicine or liquids if you cannot swallow. Some IV lines can also be used to collect blood samples.",
      "Medicines: Antipyretics decrease a fever. Thrombolytics break apart blood clots. Anticoagulants and antiplatelets prevent blood clots. Pain medicine may be given. Do not wait until the pain is severe before you ask for more pain medicine. Sedatives help decrease the pressure in your brain, and can also help decrease pain. Other medicines may be used to treat diabetes or high blood cholesterol, or to prevent seizures. Medicine may be given to keep your blood pressure at a certain level if it is too high or too low.",
      "Tests: Blood tests may be used to monitor your condition while you are being treated for your stroke. You may need tests to check if you are getting the right amount of medicine to prevent clots. You may need blood gas tests to check your oxygen level if you are on a ventilator. CT or MRI pictures may show blood flow blockage in your brain that may cause a stroke. The pictures can also show bleeding or damage if you already had a stroke. You may be given contrast liquid to help any bleeding or damage show up better in the pictures. Tell the healthcare provider if you have ever had an allergic reaction to contrast liquid. Do not enter the MRI room with metal. Metal can cause serious injury. Tell the healthcare provider if you have any metal in or on your body. Arteriography is a type of x-ray used to check your arteries for blood flow blockage and bleeding.",
      "Monitoring: Extra oxygen may be given if your oxygen level drops too low. You may need a ventilator to give you oxygen if you cannot breathe on your own. Healthcare providers will check your vital signs. Vital signs include blood pressure, heart rate, breathing rate, and temperature. The providers will also ask about your pain. Intake and output means the amount of liquid you are getting and how much you are urinating is recorded. You may need a Foley catheter. A Foley catheter is a tube placed in your bladder to drain your urine into a bag. Healthcare providers will remove the catheter as soon as possible, to prevent infection. A neurologic exam can show healthcare providers how well your brain works after an injury or illness. A provider will check how your pupils react to light. The provider may check your memory and how easily you wake up. Your hand grasp and balance may also be tested. An ICP monitor is used to keep an ongoing measurement of the pressure inside your skull. A small tube is put through your skull and connected to a screen.",
      "Treatment: Physical and occupational therapy may help you recover more quickly and prevent muscle shortening and bedsores. You may also learn new ways to do things such as dressing and bathing. Physical and occupational therapists may exercise your arms, legs, and hands. They will help you be active as soon as possible after your stroke. You will learn to move carefully to lower your risk for falling. Bladder and bowel training may help if you have trouble controlling your urine and bowel movements. A bladder training program can teach you ways to control when you urinate. A bowel program can help you learn how to plan for bowel movements. This training can help your skin stay clean and dry, and help prevent skin breakdown. Swallow therapy can help prevent you from breathing food or liquid into your lungs. A therapist can help you learn safe ways to swallow. You may need to wear pressure stockings. The stockings are tight and put pressure on your legs. This improves blood flow and helps prevent clots. You may need to wear inflatable boots after surgery. The boots have an air pump that tightens and loosens different areas of the boots. This device improves blood flow and helps prevent clots.",
      "Treatment options: The following list of medications are related to or used in the treatment of this condition: ticlopidine isoxsuprine",
      "A feeding tube: A feeding tube may be needed if you cannot swallow food or liquids. The tube may also be used to let air or fluids out of your stomach.",
      "Surgery: A tube may be placed into your skull to drain extra fluid and to check the pressure in your brain. A craniotomy is a small hole put in your skull to relieve pressure and remove blood from around your brain. A blood vessel filter helps prevent complications from a blood clot in your leg (DVT).",
      "RISKS: A BSI is life-threatening, and you may not recover from it. Blood clots may break loose and travel to your lungs or brain. Your breathing may get worse. You may need a machine to help you breathe. You may go into a coma. You may be paralyzed. You are at greater risk for falling after a stroke. You may develop medical problems such as muscle shortening or bedsores. Your brain may be damaged by the stroke, and you may have seizures. Without treatment, the damage caused by a stroke can get worse, and your risk for another stroke increases. Even with treatment, you may have lasting problems talking, thinking, or moving your body. You may not be able to care for yourself or live alone. You could have another stroke, even after treatment. You may have side effects from the medicines you are given. You may have an allergic reaction to the contrast liquid used during a CT or MRI scan. The contrast liquid may cause kidney damage. You may have a seizure during a test or treatment.

    "title": "Atherosclerosis Care Notes",
    "content": [
      "What is atherosclerosis? Atherosclerosis is the process of cholesterol plaque buildup in arteries. It can lead to a narrowing of the arteries that can significantly reduce the blood supply to vital organs such as the heart, brain, and intestines. In atherosclerosis, the arteries are narrowed when fatty deposits called plaques build up inside. Plaques typically contain cholesterol from low-density lipoproteins (LDL), smooth-muscle cells and fibrous tissue, and sometimes calcium.",
      "As a plaque grows along the lining of an artery, it can sometimes rupture, leading to the formation of a blood clot inside the artery, which can totally block blood flow. As a result, the organ supplied by the blocked artery starves for blood and oxygen. The organ's cells may either die or suffer severe damage.",
      "Atherosclerosis is the main cause of death and disability in industrialized nations, including the United States. This is because atherosclerosis is the underlying medical problem in most patients with any of the following illnesses: Coronary artery disease — In this chronic (long-lasting) disease, atherosclerosis narrows the coronary arteries, the arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle. This can lead to the chest pain called angina. It also increases the risk of a heart attack, which occurs when a coronary artery is blocked completely.",
      "Stroke — A blood clot (thrombus) may form inside a brain artery that has been narrowed by atherosclerosis. Once this thrombus forms, it cuts off the blood supply to part of the brain, causing a thrombotic stroke. Currently, about 75% of strokes in industrialized countries are thrombotic strokes.",
      "Abdominal pain and bowel infarction — When atherosclerosis narrows arteries that supply blood to the intestines, it can cause abdominal pain. Complete, sudden blockage of intestinal blood supply can cause a bowel infarction. A bowel infarction is similar to a heart attack, but it involves the intestines rather than the heart.",
      "Atherosclerosis of the extremities — Atherosclerosis can narrow the major arteries that supply blood to the legs, especially the femoral and popliteal arteries. This is often called peripheral artery disease (PAD) or peripheral vascular disease (PVD). The femoral and popiteal arteries are affected in 80% to 90% of people with this problem. The reduced blood flow to the legs may result in a crampy leg pain during exercise called intermittent claudication. If blood flow is compromised severely, parts of the leg may become pale or cyanotic (turn blue), feel cold to the touch and eventually develop gangrene.",
      "Other conditions — Atherosclerosis may be a factor in the development of an aortic aneurysm or renal artery stenosis (narrowing of the kidney arteries).",
      "Factors that increase your risk of developing atherosclerosis include: High blood cholesterol level High level of LDL (bad) cholesterol High levels of triglycerides High levels of lipoprotein(a) High blood pressure (hypertension) Diabetes Family history of CAD at a younger age Cigarette smoking Obesity Physical inactivity Inflammation, often detected by high levels of C-reactive protein, a marker in the blood.",
      "Symptoms of atherosclerosis: Atherosclerosis usually doesn't cause any symptoms until blood supply to an organ is reduced. When this happens, symptoms vary, depending on the specific organ involved: Heart — Symptoms include the chest pain of angina and shortness of breath, sweating, nausea, dizziness or light-headedness, breathlessness or palpitations. Brain — When atherosclerosis narrows brain arteries, it can cause dizziness or confusion; weakness or paralysis on one side of the body; sudden, severe numbness in any part of the body; visual disturbance, including sudden loss of vision; difficulty walking, including staggering or veering; coordination problems in the arms and hands; and slurred speech or inability to speak. If symptoms completely disappear within an hour or a bit longer, the episode is called a transient ischemic attack (TIA). When atherosclerosis completely blocks the brain arteries and/or the above symptoms last longer, it's generally called a stroke.",
      "Abdomen — When atherosclerosis narrows the arteries to the intestines, there may be dull or cramping pain in the middle of the abdomen, usually beginning 15 to 30 minutes after a meal. Sudden complete blockage of an intestinal artery often causes severe abdominal pain, sometimes with vomiting, bloody stool, and abdominal swelling.",
      "Legs — Narrowing of the leg arteries from atherosclerosis is known as peripheral artery disease. It can cause cramping pain in the leg muscles, especially during exercise. If narrowing is severe, there may be pain at rest, cold toes and feet, pale or bluish skin, and hair loss on the legs.",
      "Diagnosing atherosclerosis: Your doctor will review your medical history, your current symptoms, and any medications you are taking. Your doctor will ask you about your family history of heart disease, stroke, and other circulatory problems, and your family history of high blood cholesterol. He or she will ask about cigarette smoking, your diet, and how much exercise you get.",
      "Your doctor will measure your blood pressure and heart rate. He or she will examine you, paying special attention to your circulation, sometimes listening to the arteries in the neck. The exam includes feeling for pulses in your neck, wrists, groin, and feet. Your doctor may check the blood pressure in your legs to compare it to the pressure in your arms. The ratio of your blood pressure at your ankle to the blood pressure inside your elbow is called an ankle-brachial index or ABI.",
      "Signs of impaired circulation include: Weak pulses Cool skin that is pale or blue in the lower legs and feet Bruits (the rough sound of turbulent blood flow through narrowed arteries) heard with a stethoscope in the neck, abdomen, and groin An ABI of 0.9 or lower.",
      "Your doctor will order blood tests to measure your total, LDL, and HDL cholesterol levels, triglyceride level, fasting blood sugar, hemoglobin A1c (a measure of blood sugars over the prior three months), and sometimes hs-CRP (C-reactive protein, a marker for inflammation), and Lp(a) (lipoprotein(a), a fatty particle linked to a heightened risk of heart attack). A routine electrocardiogram (EKG) occasionally will uncover electrical changes in the heart that indicate poor blood flow to the heart muscle. Your doctor may order an EKG performed during an exercise stress test if you have any symptoms suggestive of coronary artery disease.",
      "Imaging tests such as CT scans or MRIs can sometimes be done (or reviewed if already done for a different reason). They can reveal calcium buildup (a sign of atherosclerosis) in arteries of the heart, the aorta, carotid arteries to the brain, or in the abdomen. A calcium score test is a CT scan of the heart to look for this buildup in the heart arteries. A carotid ultrasound is an ultrasound looking for cholesterol plaque or blockage in the arteries to the brain.",
      "Treatment options: The following list of medications are related to or used in the treatment of this condition: Crestor Rosuvastatin",
      "Expected duration of atherosclerosis: Atherosclerosis is a long-term condition that continues to worsen over many decades without changes in lifestyle and medication if necessary.",
      "Preventing atherosclerosis: You can help to prevent atherosclerosis by changing your risk factors for the illness. You should practice a lifestyle that promotes good circulation and combats atherosclerosis: Avoid cigarette smoking. If you smoke, it is essential that you quit. Maintain a healthy weight. Obesity, especially a concentration of body fat around the waist, has been linked to unhealthy levels of HDL cholesterol and triglycerides. Eat a healthy diet that is rich in vegetables and fruits. Avoid saturated and trans fats. Use monounsaturated (olive) and polyunsaturated (sunflower, safflower, peanut, canola) oils for cooking. Dietary protein should come primarily from fish and plant sources (soy, beans, legumes). Exercise regularly. Control high blood pressure. You may have to take medication to do this. If you have never been diagnosed with high blood pressure, you should have it checked every two years. If you have diabetes, you need to work even harder on controlling weight, exercising more, lowering LDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels, and keeping blood pressure less than 140/90. If you do not have diabetes, you should have a fasting blood sugar test every few years if you have risk factors for diabetes (being overweight, having high blood pressure or high cholesterol) starting at age 45. Work with your doctor to maintain proper cholesterol levels. If you have never been diagnosed with cholesterol problems, you should have your cholesterol checked every five years starting at age 20.",
      "Treating atherosclerosis: There is no cure for atherosclerosis, but treatment can slow or halt the worsening of the disease. The major treatment goal is to prevent significant narrowing of the arteries so that symptoms never develop and vital organs are never damaged. To do this, you would begin by following the healthy lifestyle outlined above. If you have high cholesterol that cannot be controlled by diet and exercise, your doctor will likely recommend medication. The most common medicines used to lower cholesterol are statin drugs, also known as HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. Statins block an enzyme called HMG-CoA reductase, which controls the production of cholesterol in the liver. Examples include: Lovastatin (Mevacor) Simvastatin (Zocor) Pravastatin (Pravachol) Fluvastatin (Lescol) Atorvastatin (Lipitor)"

    "content": [
      "1. Learning Outcome: Recall the causes of stroke. Describe the pathophysiology of stroke. Summarize the signs and symptoms of stroke. List the nursing needs of a patient with a stroke.",
      "2. Introduction: A cerebrovascular accident, more commonly known as a 'stroke,' is broadly classified as either ischemic or hemorrhagic. In either category, the result is a loss of blood flow, nutrients, and oxygen to a region of the brain, resulting in neuronal damage and subsequent neurological deficits. There are numerous causes of stroke, such as prolonged hypertension, arteriosclerosis, and emboli, that have formed as a result of atrial fibrillation or rheumatic fever. In younger patients, the possible list of causes may be broadened to include clotting disorders and various forms of vasculitis. In children, sickle cell anemia is also a common cause of stroke. In the event of a possible stroke presentation, a precise history and physical must be performed alongside emergent neurological imaging before administering any form of treatment. With early, focused treatment based on the stroke etiology, rehabilitation programs, and long-term lifestyle changes, one can maximize their chances for a meaningful recovery.",
      "3. Nursing Diagnosis: Inadequate cerebral perfusion. Impaired ability to communicate. Impairment in physical mobility. Altered sensory perception. Inability to perform daily living activities. Impaired swallowing. Ineffective coping.",
      "4. Causes: Many etiologies can lead to a stroke. One of the most common causes is plaque formation secondary to low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) buildup within the arteries. The most common risk factors include hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and smoking. Thrombi can also develop at the bifurcation sites of the internal carotid, middle cerebral arteries, and basilar arteries. Emboli that cause strokes are thrombi formed at a distant site and then lodged in an artery of the brain. Embolic strokes are commonly caused by emboli that originate from the heart, especially in patients with preexisting heart arrhythmias (atrial fibrillation), valvular disease, structural defects (atrial and ventricular septal defects), and rheumatic fever. Emboli usually lodge in areas of preexisting stenosis.",
      "Strokes that occur in small vessels are most commonly caused by chronic, uncontrolled hypertension and arteriosclerosis. These strokes occur in the basal ganglia, internal capsule, thalamus, and pons. Uncontrolled hypertension in these areas can also lead to small hemorrhages.",
      "About 20% of all strokes are classified as hemorrhagic, with the most common etiology being uncontrolled hypertension. Other causes of hemorrhagic strokes include cerebral amyloid angiopathy, a disease in which amyloid plaques deposit in small and medium vessels, which causes vessels to become rigid and more vulnerable to tears. Deposition can occur anywhere, but they occur most commonly on the surfaces of the frontal and parietal lobes. The structural integrity of vessels is another critical consideration in hemorrhagic stroke. Aneurysms, arteriovenous malformations, cavernous malformations, capillary telangiectasias, venous angiomas, and vasculitis have all been identified as common causes of hemorrhagic strokes.",
      "5. Risk Factors: In the United States, stroke is the fifth most common cause of death, and 60% of strokes occur outside hospitals. On average, every 40 seconds, a person suffers from a stroke, and every 4 minutes, one death is caused by a stroke. Stroke is the leading cause of disability worldwide. Risk factors for stroke include: Advanced age Smoking Obesity Diabetes Hypertension Physical inactivity Hyperlipidemia",
      "6. Assessment: A thorough history is a critical first step toward making a diagnosis. A stroke should be high on the differential for a patient presenting with sudden, focal neurological deficits and/or an altered level of consciousness. Based on clinical presentation alone, it is almost impossible to differentiate between a hemorrhagic and an ischemic stroke. Common signs and symptoms include hemiparesis, sensory deficits, diplopia, dysarthria, and facial droop. More posterior strokes present with a sudden onset of ataxia and vertigo. Symptoms commonly attributed to increased intracranial pressure, such as nausea, vomiting, headache, and blurred or double vision, may provide evidence supporting a hemorrhagic stroke. In addition to gathering information about the symptoms, one needs to establish the time of their onset to decide whether fibrinolytic therapy is an option once the diagnosis of ischemic stroke is confirmed.",
      "A neurological exam is performed to ascertain stroke location, establish baseline function upon hospital admission, rule out a transient ischemic attack (TIA) and other stroke mimickers, and deduce potential comorbidities. It is composed of testing cranial nerve function, the range of motion and muscle strength, sensory integrity, vibratory sense, cerebellar function, gait, language, mental status, and level of consciousness. Baseline function is determined via the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), which focuses on the level of consciousness, visual and motor function, sensation and neglect, cerebellar function, and language capabilities. A peripheral vasculature exam is also completed and includes palpation of the carotid, radial, femoral, and posterior tibial pulses.",
      "Common signs and symptoms of stroke include: Numbness or weakness of the face Change in mental status Trouble speaking or understanding speech Visual disturbances Homonymous hemianopsia - loss of half of the visual field Loss of peripheral vision Hemiparesis or hemiplegia - Weakness or paralysis of the face, arm, and leg on the same side Ataxia - unsteady gait and inability to keep feet together Dysarthria - difficulty in forming words Dysphagia - difficulty in swallowing Paresthesia - numbness and tingling of extremities Expressive aphasia - unable to form understandable words Receptive aphasia - unable to comprehend the spoken word",
      "7. Evaluation: Serum blood glucose level via bedside finger-stick testing should be the first test for patients with neurologic deficits. This is to help identify and correct hypoglycemia if it is present.",
      "Emergent non-contrast computed tomography (CT) of the head is one of the first diagnostic tests obtained in patients suspected of having a stroke. This test will identify hemorrhagic stroke if it is present. The non-contrast CT may not readily identify ischemic strokes. Patients will usually undergo further neurologic imaging immediately after obtaining a noncontact CT. This imaging may include specialized contrast CT imaging to evaluate brain perfusion and/or contrast-enhanced CT angiography of the head and neck to identify any blocked vessels. At some centers, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is utilized for this additional imaging because of its superior sensitivity in detecting ischemic lesions.",
      "Cardiac monitoring with bedside telemetry and electrocardiograms is obtained in all patients with stroke-like symptoms.",
      "Additional testing will include serum troponin, complete blood count with differential, lipid profile, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), blood urine nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, albumin, and glomerular filtration rate (GFR). In younger patients presenting with stroke symptoms, other labs that might be ordered include a coagulation panel, rheumatoid factor (RF), anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA), and other markers for vasculitis. In some cases, an electroencephalogram (EEG) may be obtained to rule out a post-seizure state.",
      "8. Medical Management: Ischemic Stroke: Before any treatment can be administered, the patient must be assessed for a stable airway, breathing, and circulation. The first-line treatment for patients with an ischemic stroke is intravenous thrombolytic therapy which is administered as an intravenous bolus of alteplase given over 1 minute, followed by an infusion over 60 minutes. The exclusion criteria for this treatment are based on guidelines from the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association. This therapy aims to dissolve the clot and restore blood flow to the affected regions. Time management is of the utmost importance in patients with an ischemic stroke because the fibrinolytic/thrombolytic therapy must be administered within 3 to 4.5 hours after symptom onset to be effective. In recent years significant advancements have been made in acute stroke care with the emergence of mechanical thrombectomy to remove the occluding clot and reestablish blood flow to the brain. Within 24 to 48 hours of symptoms onset, patients should be placed on oral anti-platelet therapy, typically 325 mg of aspirin. Blood pressure should be maintained at slightly elevated levels for the first few days after a stroke to counter vasoconstriction. Blood pressure should also be lowered gradually over the next few days to treat underlying hypertension.",
      "Hemorrhagic Stroke: Some patients will undergo catheter-directed intracranial intervention for the cause of a spontaneous hemorrhagic stroke. Most patients with this type of stroke are managed with intervention to relieve intracranial pressure, such as ventricular drain placement and/or a craniotomy. Patients who were previously on anticoagulation agents will need reversal agents and plasma product transfusions to reverse coagulopathy. Blood pressure should be monitored frequently with a goal systolic pressure of 140 mmHg. To avoid over or under-correction, systolic blood pressure is acceptable within the range of 130 to 150 mmHg in these patients. Some patients will be on seizure medications prophylactically to prevent spontaneous epileptiform discharges.",
      "9. Nursing Management: Assess mental status and level of consciousness Observe for neurological deficits with frequent and serial neurological assessments Measure and monitor pupil size Assess breathing Monitor vital signs Assess higher functions like speech, memory, and cognition Provide a quiet environment with the head of the bed elevated Elevate bed rails to prevent falls Leave the nurse bell button at the side of the bed in case the patient needs to go to the bathroom Prevent constipation and straining with stool softeners Watch for seizures Observe for changes in mood Provide deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis",
      "When To Seek Help: If a change in mental status or loss of consciousness occurs If a change in neurologic assessments is noted If the patient experiences difficulty breathing or shortness of breath If vital sign assessment reveals fever or a sudden change in heart rate and/or blood pressure If the patient is unable to void If the patient has any evidence of skin breakdown If the patient experiences a fall",
      "Outcome Identification: Improved consciousness Alert with preserved motor and sensory function Can ambulate, speak and swallow No signs of any neurologic deficits Stable vital signs",
      "10. Monitoring: Neurologic assessments Vital signs Cardiac rhythm monitoring Ability to swallow Ability to void urine Muscle strength and mobility Mood and behavior",
      "11. Coordination of Care: During the time-dependent early stroke phase and rehabilitation, stroke care involves an interprofessional team to prevent the disease. Once the stroke diagnosis is made, the patient may need extensive physical rehabilitation, speech therapy, and/or a dietary consult. For those who recover function within three months, the prognosis is good, but for those with residual neurological deficits, the outcome is guarded. Nurses must coordinate care with these interprofessional team members to ensure functional assessments and speech/swallow assessments have been made for these patients with the implementation of recommended interventions.",
      "12. Health Teaching and Health Promotion: Educate the patient and caregiver on the following: Eating healthy Do not lead a sedentary lifestyle Observe compliance with medications Follow up with a clinician Do not smoke Control blood pressure, blood glucose, and hyperlipidemia Participate in regular exercise",
      "13. Risk Management: Patients with a stroke can deteriorate rapidly. Others may aspirate, fall or develop seizures. Thus, the nurse should monitor the patient closely for any new neurological deficit and inform the clinician. The bed railings should be raised because there is a high risk of falls. The patient must be assisted to compensate for any functional impairments that may increase their risk of falls.",
      "14. Discharge Planning: According to the American Heart Association and American Stroke Association, the following points are an essential part of the discharge discussion: Education regarding the causes of stroke Education regarding modifiable risk factors for stroke Education regarding blood pressure and glucose management Education regarding healthy dietary intake Education regarding the use of assistive devices, as advised by the therapy teams to prevent the risk of falls Emphasizing medication compliance Emphasizing follow-up compliance Ensuring patients and caregivers understand the signs and symptoms of stroke to ensure timely evaluation in the event of a recurrent stroke Ensuring patients and caregivers understand potential complications of therapy, especially bleeding, if they are discharged on blood thinners"

      "Stroke Pathophysiology: A stroke is a sudden neurological event caused by a disruption of blood flow to the brain, leading to inadequate perfusion. Two types of strokes are ischemic and hemorrhagic. Ischemic strokes result from a lack of sufficient blood and oxygen supply, while hemorrhagic strokes result from bleeding in the brain due to ruptured blood vessels. Around 10-15% of all strokes are hemorrhagic, which have higher mortality rates.",

    "title": "Care of the Patient With Acute Ischemic Stroke (Posthyperacute and Prehospital Discharge): Update to 2009 Comprehensive Nursing Care Scientific Statement: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association",
    "content": [
      "Care Transition Interventions for Survivors of Stroke: The discharge transition from the acute setting to the community is one of the most vulnerable and significant periods in the continuum of care for patients with stroke and their families. Thus, dedicated communication and organization among the health care team members are essential. The principal goals of a healthy transition include preparing survivors of stroke and their family members for discharge, ensuring optimal secondary stroke prevention, maximizing stroke recovery and rehabilitation, avoiding unnecessary complications and hospital readmissions, and ensuring the best achievable quality of life for patients and their caregivers. Determination of postacute rehabilitation needs should be based on this assessment and assessments of residual neurological deficits; cognitive, communication, and psychological status; swallowing ability; determination of previous functional ability and medical comorbidities; level of family/caregiver support; capacity of family caregivers to meet the care needs of their family member with stroke; likelihood of returning to community living; and ability to participate in rehabilitation. Strong interprofessional communication and collaboration are required among nurses, therapists, and family members to maximize the effectiveness and efficiency of early rehabilitation. The discharge process may involve rehabilitation nursing case managers and social workers who can assess psychosocial issues that may influence the transition.",
      "Key elements pertaining to the successful transition of care are listed in the Figure. The recommended discharge planning topics incorporate elements from several poststroke discharge resources. From this list, a coordinated and holistic assessment and specific plan for the patient with stroke and their family must be developed to facilitate a successful transition.",
      "Secondary Stroke Prevention: Secondary stroke prevention requires collaboration from all members of the health care team, which includes treatment of the specific stroke mechanism and reduction of modifiable stroke risk factors (eg, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia). Optimal secondary stroke prevention also involves promoting a healthy lifestyle through diet and exercise, smoking cessation, and addressing social concerns.",
      "Foremost in this transition is the provision of stroke education to patients and families on the signs and symptoms of stroke and the importance of stroke risk factor reduction. To increase the effectiveness of these educational interventions, health care providers should implement evidence-based educational strategies that are individualized and tailored to patients’ health needs and medical conditions. One method for stroke education is the use of educational pamphlets, which have been demonstrated to be an effective method to improve patients’ knowledge and awareness of risk factors for acute ischemic stroke such as obstructive sleep apnea. Another modality to deliver stroke education is online programs, which are preferred by some survivors of stroke and allow education to be delivered throughout the transition period and in the home setting. In addition, developing culturally tailored educational interventions is critical to guarantee the success of stroke survivor education, especially for minorities and underrepresented groups. As an example, in a multiethnic cohort, a culturally tailored, skills-based educational program with telephone follow-up was effective in reducing systolic BP among Hispanic patients at 12 months compared with standard discharge programs.",
      "Although optimal secondary stroke prevention requires an interprofessional effort, nurse-led interventions may be among the most effective approaches and reduce 30-day readmissions of patients with stroke discharged to home. In a study of a Swedish stroke cohort, patients were assigned a specially trained nurse who would maintain contact, perform needed educational interventions, assess patient and caregiver needs, ensure adherence with the treatment schedule/regimen, identify emerging health issues, and request additional input and referrals as needed. However, this strategy requires regular communication between the nurse and provider team and may not be generalizable to resource-limited settings.",
      "Self-Management of the Survivor and Family Caregiver: Self-management for survivors of stroke seeks to optimize independence in the posthospital environment by educating patients and caregivers on the skills of decision making and problem-solving, as well as establishing goals for stroke prevention and recovery. Teaching should begin in the acute setting before hospital discharge. In a meta-analysis of multiple systematic reviews, self-management interventions were effective in reducing mortality and fostering independence among survivors of stroke. Examples of self-management interventions include enhancing self-efficacy with activities of daily living, teaching problem-solving skills and strategies, engaging patients in occupational therapy programs, and incorporating information provision for survivors of stroke and their caregivers on stroke care after discharge. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 18 randomized trials of interventions that focused on developing problem-solving and coping strategies for stroke family caregivers further revealed a positive effect on caregivers’ psychological health and a reduction in health care resource use.",
      "In addition, it is imperative to identify premorbid depression and PSD, to provide prompt and targeted treatment, and to make any necessary referrals for supportive mental health therapy. With improved awareness of the presence of PSD, including its variability and detrimental effects among survivors, more tailored patient and family interventions can be applied to address immediate needs and to enhance stroke recovery.",
      "Reducing Readmissions: Hospital readmission during the 30 days after discharge has been identified by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services as a key quality indicator for survivors of stroke. In 2013, ≈12% of US patients with stroke had a readmission within 30 days, of which 90% were unscheduled and 13% were deemed preventable. Preventing poststroke complications and hospital readmissions requires an interprofessional effort. A nurse-led transitional stroke clinic where the nurse performs follow-up phone calls and conducts office visits at regular time intervals after discharge may be an effective model for reducing readmission rates among survivors of stroke. Moreover, team-coordinated early supported discharge helps prepare survivors of stroke and caregivers for the transition period, incorporating the recommended discharge planning topics outlined in the Figure.",
      "In a qualitative study of patient-reported indicators of hospital readmission, participants identified several important factors, including poor preparation before discharge, insufficient medication reconciliation, lack of education on anticipated needs and resources, and limited support to receive available community services. Although the sample size was small, the study suggestions for discharge preparation are applicable to the broader stroke population in that an individually tailored discharge plan and assessment of understanding of the plan by patients and caregivers are essential. Furthermore, patients should be oriented to location-specific available community resources and provided an early follow-up appointment scheduled before discharge. This is even more critical for patients in rural and socioeconomically disparate areas where access to resources and rehabilitation services and distance to posthospital follow-up are important barriers to a successful transition to the home environment.",
      "Goals of Care: Decision making for patients with stroke, especially those who experience a complication during the acute phase of stroke, is complex. Discussion of care options and possible outcomes should take place quickly, and caregivers should ascertain and include patient preferences in shared decision making when considering interventions or limitations of care. Poor communication about prognosis and the anticipated course of illness can result in patients receiving more aggressive care and treatment than they desire. Most patients with serious illness want health care providers to initiate and have conversations about the goals of care. Clinicians should direct patients with stroke and their families to palliative care resources as appropriate. The major foci of palliative care are communication, shared decision making about treatment options, advance care planning, and attention to physical, emotional, spiritual, and psychological distress with the inclusion of the patient’s family and care system. When patients receive palliative care early in their illness trajectory, outcomes are better, including improved quality of life, less depression, and prolonged survival.",
      "The compartmentalization of stroke care delivery in a stroke unit may improve site-specific care but hinder overall care if there is fragmented communication among providers and across settings. Knowledge and use of effective communication techniques is a critical core competency to improve the quality of stroke decision making, as well as patient and family satisfaction and outcomes.",
      "Providers should be knowledgeable and respectful of diverse cultural and religious preferences when establishing goals of care and refer to social workers and chaplains when appropriate. Lutz and Green have well outlined the role of nursing in addressing palliative care needs of patients with stroke, including implementing family-centered care, ensuring families that core nursing care will be maintained, enhancing quality of life by managing symptoms, integrating spiritual care, and providing a support system for patients and caregivers.",
      "Innovation in Transitions of Care: Despite current best practices, many patients continue to receive suboptimal poststroke care in the home environment. Technological innovations in mobile health and telemedicine offer new methods to extend care remotely to patients with stroke after hospital discharge, often through the support of home health nurses. New approaches take advantage of the wide availability of tablets and smartphones and incorporate a range of novel technologies such as gaming, sensors, robotics, virtual reality, and telemedicine. A recent prospective, randomized clinical trial tested a home-based telerehabilitation system versus traditional in-clinic rehabilitation and found that patients experienced similar improvements in arm motor function regardless of the setting. In terms of secondary stroke prevention, mobile cardiac telemetry, implantable loop recorders, and smartwatches allow remote detection of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation after hospital discharge. Although additional investigation is needed into the implementation and generalizability of these novel technologies, further advances will continue to offer new ways to ensure stability and good outcomes for patients with stroke in the postdischarge environment."

    "title": "Atherosclerosis and Atherosclerosis (Nursing)",
    "content": [
      "Overview: Arteriosclerosis and atherosclerosis are interrelated cardiovascular conditions that can significantly impact cardiac health. Arteriosclerosis refers to the thickening and stiffening of arterial walls. It is commonly associated with normal aging. The subsequent loss of elasticity of blood vessels makes them less responsive to changes in blood flow and can reduce blood flow to organs and tissues within the body. Atherosclerosis is a condition where cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) deposits, and wastes build up within the lining of the arteries. This buildup of substances within the vessel walls, often referred to as plaque, creates inflammation and can cause blockage of the artery. Clients who experience arteriosclerosis often will also experience atherosclerosis as plaque accumulates within blood vessels. Conditions such as diabetes often correlate with arteriosclerosis and atherosclerosis as the result of sustained inflammation within the vessels from elevated blood glucose levels.",
      "Assessment: Signs and symptoms of arteriosclerosis and atherosclerosis often develop as a result of decreased oxygenation to tissues and organs within the body. The manifestations will vary depending on where the arterial hardening or blockage is located within the body.",
      "Clinical Manifestations of Arteriosclerosis and Atherosclerosis: Cardiovascular System: Hypertension (high blood pressure) If atherosclerosis develops in a coronary artery, chest pain (angina) associated with coronary artery disease (CAD)",
      "Peripheral Vascular: Cool extremities Pallor in extremities Weak peripheral pulses Capillary refill time greater than three seconds Signs of peripheral artery disease (PAD), such as intermittent claudication (leg pain with walking)",
      "Neurological: Transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) or stroke symptoms if cerebral arteries are affected (e.g., weakness, speech difficulties, visual disturbances, confusion) Neuropathy in extremities",
      "Renal: Decreased urine output if renal arteries are affected, causing chronic kidney disease (CKD)",
      "Integumentary: Cool or pale skin Delayed wound healing",
      "Ophthalmic: Vision loss if retinal arteries are affected",
      "Diagnostic Testing: Diagnostic testing for atherosclerosis involves various methods to assess the condition of arteries and determine the extent of plaque buildup and narrowing of the arterial walls. Laboratory tests, such as lipid profile and C-reactive protein are related to the buildup of cholesterol or inflammation within the arteries respectively. Additional diagnostic testing that may be performed include carotid ultrasound to examine blood flow within the carotid arteries. Coronary angiography and coronary CT angiography (CTA) may be ordered to visualize strictures and buildup of plaques within the coronary arteries.",
      "Nursing Problems and Diagnoses: Nursing problems and diagnoses for clients with atherosclerosis focus on identifying abnormalities and preventing complications associated with these conditions.",
      "Common nursing diagnoses for clients with atherosclerosis include the following: Risk for Impaired Tissue Integrity related to altered circulation Readiness for Enhanced Health Self-Management",
      "Outcome Identification: Outcome identification involves setting short- and long-term goals and creating expected outcome statements tailored to the client’s specific needs. These outcomes should be measurable and responsive to nursing interventions.",
      "Sample expected outcomes for common nursing diagnoses related to atherosclerosis are as follows: The client will exhibit adequate tissue perfusion, as evidenced by vital signs within normal range, warm extremities, and capillary refill less than two to three seconds. The client will verbalize three lifestyle modifications to reduce the risk of plaque buildup. The client will verbalize when to notify the health care provider of new symptoms related to worsening atherosclerosis.",
      "Interventions: Medical Interventions: Medical interventions for arteriosclerosis and atherosclerosis aim to improve blood flow through the affected arteries and reduce the risk of complications related to insufficient arterial blood flow to other organs. Interventions include lifestyle modifications, medication therapy, and surgical procedures.",
      "LIFESTYLE MODIFICATIONS: Recommended lifestyle medications include the following: Dietary Changes: Adopting a heart-healthy diet that is low in saturated fats, cholesterol, and sodium can help reduce plaque buildup and lower blood pressure. Regular Physical Activity: Engaging in regular physical activity can improve cardiovascular health, reduce cholesterol levels, and enhance overall circulation. Smoking Cessation: Quitting smoking is crucial, as smoking is a major risk factor for atherosclerosis and arterial disease. Weight Management: Achieving and maintaining a healthy weight can help improve blood pressure and reduce the workload on the heart. Blood Sugar Management: Tight control of blood sugars in clients with diabetes diminishes the progression of arteriosclerosis and atherosclerosis.",
      "MEDICATION THERAPY: Several classes of medications may be prescribed to manage atherosclerosis and arteriosclerosis: Antilipemics: Lower LDL cholesterol levels and reduce the risk of plaque buildup. Antihypertensives: Control high blood pressure and reduce strain on the arteries; vasodilators relax blood vessels and improve blood flow. Blood coagulation modifiers (Antiplatelets and anticoagulants): Prevent blood clots from forming in narrowed arteries.",
      "SURGICAL INTERVENTIONS: Several procedures or surgeries may be performed, depending on the location of the plaque buildups. An endarterectomy is the surgical removal of plaque from arteries. Procedures related to atherosclerosis in the coronary arteries are discussed in 'Medical Interventions' in the 'Coronary Artery Disease' section. In acute situations where atherosclerotic plaque becomes a thrombotic clot or embolus obstructing blood flow, thrombolytic medications may be administered.",
      "Nursing Interventions: Nursing interventions for arteriosclerosis and atherosclerosis include safely administering medications and providing health teaching about lifestyle modifications, risk factor reduction, and medication therapy.",
      "MEDICATION MANAGEMENT: Nurses administer prescribed medications and teach about potential side effects and when to notify the provider.",
      "HEALTH TEACHING: Nurses provide health teaching about lifestyle modifications to promote heart health, including dietary changes, smoking cessation, and regular physical activity. A heart-healthy diet is encouraged that is low in saturated fats, cholesterol, and sodium. If the client smokes and is ready to stop smoking, resources are provided for quitting. Realistic physical activity is recommended based on the client’s abilities. Risk factor modification, including controlling blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and blood sugar (if applicable), is emphasized during health teaching.",
      "Evaluation: During the evaluation stage, nurses determine the effectiveness of nursing interventions for a specific client. The previously identified expected outcomes are reviewed to determine if they were met, partially met, or not met by the time frames indicated. If outcomes are not met or only partially met by the time frame indicated, the nursing care plan is revised. Evaluation should occur every time the nurse implements interventions with a client, reviews updated laboratory or diagnostic test results, or discusses the care plan with other members of the interprofessional team."

    "title": "Coronary Artery Disease: Nursing Diagnoses, Care Plans, Assessment & Interventions",
    "content": [
      "Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is a term used to describe conditions that affect the arteries that provide nutrients, blood, and oxygen to the heart. Atherosclerosis, a known cause of CAD, is characterized by lipid deposits within the walls of the arteries. These plaques narrow arteries, obstructing blood flow. It increases the risk of angina and myocardial infarction. CAD is a progressive disease that develops over time. The condition is often advanced before the patient exhibits symptoms like angina, shortness of breath, and fatigue.",
      "When blood flow through the coronary arteries becomes partially or completely blocked, ischemia and infarction in the heart muscles occur. When insufficient blood and oxygen supply (ischemia) to the myocardium, decreased tissue perfusion and necrosis (infarction) will develop, requiring immediate intervention. The management of CAD involves modifying risk factors to prevent and slow disease progression. Since symptoms may not always be evident, it is important to identify people who are at risk for CAD. Nurses provide health promotion efforts that are directed toward controlling the modifiable risk factors for CAD. Patient education about the disease process and progression along with necessary lifestyle changes is important in preventing CAD.",
      "For patients who present with symptoms such as chest pain or dyspnea, medications or surgical interventions may be indicated. Medications like aspirin or cholesterol-lowering agents are prescribed to prevent blood clots and heart attacks and reduce plaque buildup in the arteries. Surgical interventions like coronary angioplasty and stent placement may be indicated to remove blockages, widen the artery, and restore blood flow to the heart. Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is indicated for patients who have multiple narrowed arteries.",
      "The first step of nursing care is the nursing assessment, during which the nurse will gather physical, psychosocial, emotional, and diagnostic data. Ask the patient about their general symptoms: chest pain, shortness of breath (dyspnea) both at rest and during activity, rapid breathing (tachypnea), difficulty of breathing while lying or sitting (orthopnea), fainting (syncope), palpitations, lower extremity edema, pain in the lower extremity, and difficulty in performing physical activities.",
      "Investigate the chest pain further: chest tightness, feeling of squeezing, heaviness, burning sensation, pain during physical activity, triggers such as stress or substance use, pain that radiates to the jaw, neck, left arm, or back. Assess the patient’s risk factors. Non-modifiable risk factors: age, gender, family history of ischemic heart disease, race/ethnicity. Modifiable risk factors: hypertension, hyperlipidemia/hypercholesterolemia, diabetes or insulin resistance, kidney disease, tobacco use, obesity, physical inactivity, diet, stress, alcohol use, lack of sleep.",
      "Review the patient’s medications and treatment record. Monitor vital signs, especially pulse rate and blood pressure. EKG and telemetry monitoring should be completed immediately when a patient reports chest pain to assess for dysrhythmias. Systemic assessment approach: neck: distended jugular veins; CNS: acute distress, dizziness, lightheadedness, syncope, and lethargy; cardiovascular: tachycardia, chest pain, abnormal heart sounds, irregular heartbeats; circulatory: decreased peripheral pulses; respiratory: dyspnea, tachypnea, orthopnea, abnormal sounds upon auscultation, activity intolerance; gastrointestinal: nausea and vomiting; lymphatic: peripheral edema; musculoskeletal: neck, arm, back, jaw, and upper body pain, fatigue; integumentary: cyanotic and pale skin and excessive sweating. Calculate the patient’s ASCVD (atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease) risk score.",
      "Diagnostic Procedures: note for arrhythmias. Obtain samples for blood work. Assist the patient in completing a stress test. Prepare the patient for cardiac catheterization. Investigate further: echocardiogram, exercise treadmill test, nuclear stress test, stress imaging, cardiac CT scans, CT coronary angiogram. Nursing Interventions: promote perfusion: reduce cholesterol plaque buildup, prevent blood clots, fix the blocked artery, monitor cholesterol levels.",
      "Manage the Symptoms: control blood pressure, relieve chest pain, know the triggers of angina, improve ischemic angina, maintain the recommended blood pressure. Cardiac Rehabilitation: adhere to the plan, prevent complications, refer to home and community health services, motivate the patient to adhere to the plan.",
      "Lower the Risk: prevention measures: promote ambulation, aim for an ideal BMI, educate the patient, cope with stress, manage comorbidities, emphasize when to seek medical attention, teach the importance of lifestyle modification, consider taking omega-3 fatty acids, acknowledge the possible use of alternative medicine, follow up with a cardiologist. Provide Safety: use blood thinners with caution, implement bleeding precautions, remind the patient about medical identification.",
      "Nursing Care Plans: acute pain: assess and monitor vital signs, assess pain characteristics, assess diagnostic studies, provide supplemental oxygen as needed, administer medications promptly as indicated, raise the head of the bed, maintain a quiet and comfortable environment, help the patient recognize triggers. Anxiety: assess stress levels, monitor vital signs, encourage the patient to express feelings and fears, provide reassurance to the patient, administer medications as indicated, provide accurate information about the disease, encourage coping methods for relaxation.",
      "Decreased Cardiac Output: assess heart rate, blood pressure, and cardiac rhythm, assess breath and heart sounds, assess skin color and pulse, allow adequate rest periods, stress the importance of avoiding bearing down or straining, administer medications as indicated, prepare for tests and procedures. Ineffective Tissue Perfusion: determine the patient’s vascularization status, calculate ankle-brachial index, assess the patient’s skin color, capillary refill, and sensations, use Doppler ultrasound, administer medications to improve blood flow, prepare for a possible surgical procedure, start aspirin therapy as ordered, instruct on mobility and activity contraindications, refer the patient to cardiac rehab.",
      "Risk for Unstable Blood Pressure: track the patient’s blood pressure, assess for signs and symptoms, determine the patient’s risk factors, assess body fat, advise caution with exertional activities, administer medications as prescribed, educate on blood pressure control, emphasize blood pressure control in lifestyle modification, assist with stress testing."

    "title": "Nursing Care Plan For Arteriosclerosis",
    "content": [
      "Introduction: Arteriosclerosis, also known as atherosclerosis, is a chronic condition characterized by the narrowing and hardening of the arteries due to the accumulation of plaque. This condition significantly increases the risk of various cardiovascular diseases, such as coronary artery disease, peripheral arterial disease, and cerebrovascular disease. Developing a comprehensive nursing care plan for arteriosclerosis is crucial to effectively manage the condition, prevent complications, and promote the well-being of individuals affected by this vascular disease. The nursing care plan for arteriosclerosis focuses on addressing the unique needs of individuals with this condition and aims to optimize cardiovascular health, manage risk factors, and enhance overall quality of life. It involves a holistic approach that encompasses assessment, diagnosis, planning, implementation, and evaluation.",
      "Key components of the nursing care plan for arteriosclerosis include assessing and monitoring cardiovascular status, managing risk factors, promoting a healthy lifestyle, providing education and support, and collaborating with the healthcare team to ensure coordinated and integrated care. Through regular assessment, nursing professionals can monitor cardiovascular parameters such as blood pressure, heart rate, and peripheral pulses, and identify any signs of disease progression or complications. This information guides the development of individualized care plans and helps in early intervention. Risk factor management plays a significant role in the care plan for arteriosclerosis. Nurses collaborate with patients to identify modifiable risk factors, such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, smoking, diabetes, obesity, and sedentary lifestyle. Interventions include medication administration, lifestyle modifications (such as dietary changes and physical activity), and patient education to enhance self-management skills.",
      "Collaboration with the healthcare team, including physicians, dieticians, physical therapists, and pharmacists, is vital to ensure a comprehensive and coordinated approach to care. Regular evaluation of the care plan and patient outcomes helps nurses to modify interventions as needed and ensure optimal management of arteriosclerosis. Assessment is a crucial step in developing a nursing care plan for individuals with arteriosclerosis. It involves a comprehensive evaluation of the patient’s cardiovascular health, risk factors, and overall well-being. The following nursing assessment focuses on key areas relevant to arteriosclerosis: Obtain a detailed medical history, including any previous diagnoses of cardiovascular disease, such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, or diabetes. Assess the patient’s family history of cardiovascular disease. Inquire about lifestyle factors, such as smoking history, physical activity level, and dietary habits. Identify any symptoms experienced by the patient, such as chest pain (angina), shortness of breath, or peripheral artery disease symptoms (e.g., leg pain, skin changes).",
      "Cardiovascular Assessment: Measure and record the patient’s blood pressure, heart rate, and peripheral pulses. Assess the patient’s heart sounds and note any abnormalities, such as murmurs or irregular rhythms. Observe for signs of inadequate perfusion, such as pallor, coolness, or delayed capillary refill in the extremities. Assess for the presence of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) by checking pulses, evaluating skin color and temperature, and performing a vascular assessment. Risk Factor Assessment: Assess modifiable risk factors, such as smoking, sedentary lifestyle, poor diet, obesity, and stress levels. Evaluate lipid profile levels, including total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides. Check blood glucose levels to assess for diabetes or prediabetes. Assess the patient’s medication history, including current antihypertensive, lipid-lowering, and antiplatelet medications.",
      "Physical Examination: Perform a general physical examination, including height, weight, and body mass index (BMI) assessment. Assess the patient’s overall appearance, noting any signs of peripheral edema or fluid retention. Examine the skin for signs of poor circulation, such as ulcers, coolness, or color changes. Palpate peripheral pulses to assess for strength and symmetry. Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests: Review the patient’s laboratory results, including lipid profile, fasting blood glucose, and hemoglobin A1C levels. Assess renal function through blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels. Evaluate liver function through liver enzyme tests, such as alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST). Consider additional diagnostic tests, such as electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiogram, or stress testing, based on the patient’s specific clinical presentation.",
      "A comprehensive nursing assessment provides a foundation for developing an individualized care plan for individuals with arteriosclerosis. It guides the selection of appropriate nursing interventions, facilitates effective risk factor management, and promotes cardiovascular health. Regular reassessment is essential to monitor disease progression, identify emerging needs, and adapt the care plan accordingly. Collaboration with the healthcare team, including physicians and cardiovascular specialists, ensures a holistic and coordinated approach to care. Nursing Diagnoses for Arteriosclerosis: Ineffective Tissue Perfusion related to decreased arterial blood flow and narrowing of the arteries. Risk for Impaired Skin Integrity related to compromised circulation and reduced tissue perfusion. Imbalanced Nutrition: Less Than Body Requirements related to dietary restrictions and decreased appetite. Ineffective Self-Health Management related to insufficient knowledge of risk factors and lifestyle modifications.",
      "Risk for Activity Intolerance related to reduced oxygen supply to tissues and decreased cardiovascular endurance. Risk for Impaired Gas Exchange related to compromised blood flow to the pulmonary system. Anxiety related to the fear of complications and uncertainty about the disease progression. Deficient Knowledge regarding arteriosclerosis, risk factors, and self-care measures. Risk for Falls related to impaired peripheral circulation and decreased balance. Ineffective Coping related to the emotional impact of arteriosclerosis and the need for lifestyle modifications. These nursing diagnoses provide a basis for identifying the specific needs and concerns of individuals with arteriosclerosis. They guide the development of appropriate nursing interventions to address the identified problems and promote the patient’s well-being. It is important to tailor the nursing diagnoses to the individual patient’s assessment findings and collaborate with the healthcare team to ensure a comprehensive and coordinated approach to care. Regular reassessment and evaluation are necessary to monitor disease progression and the effectiveness of interventions in achieving desired patient outcomes.",
      "Nursing Interventions for Arteriosclerosis: Promote Tissue Perfusion: Encourage regular physical activity within the patient’s capabilities to improve blood flow and promote collateral circulation. Assist with positioning to optimize blood flow to affected areas (e.g., elevating legs for peripheral artery disease). Provide warm compresses or heating pads to promote vasodilation and enhance tissue perfusion.

      "M.T. is a 56-year-old mom in the midst of doing it all. Caring for her kids and her husband while finishing up with last-minute editing for work, M.T. begins to have symptoms. She becomes warm, diaphoretic, and puts her hand to her chest as she feels the uncomfortable achiness within her chest radiating to her jaw/throat and then down her arm. Thinking she is having indigestion, M.T. reaches for her antacid. However, her symptoms worsen, the intensity of the discomfort increases, dizziness ensues, and she becomes unstable on her feet. Her denial that this is happening continues; M.T. attempts to stabilize herself and responds to the multiple activities at hand, taking care of everyone else but herself. Her symptoms intensify further, forcing her to sit down as she calls 911 for help. She hears the emergency medical technician report sinus rhythm with inferior ST depression on the electrocardiogram and obtain the stat labs, including troponin and creatine kinase–MB.",
      "Upon further inquiry of her past medical history, M.T. reveals hypertension that she contributes to stress and a history of hyperlipidemia and rheumatoid arthritis. M.T. is a nonsmoker and nondiabetic and does not have a family history of premature coronary artery disease. Her vital signs showed an elevated blood pressure of 152/90, heart rate of 98, respiratory rate of 16, and pulse oximetry of 98% O2 saturation, and physical examination was significant for an increased body mass index (BMI) of 32 and an increased waist circumference of 42 inches; the rest of her physical examination was normal. M.T. reflects back to her first office visit with her health care provider (HCP) and ponders what could have been done differently to prevent this acute scenario?",
      "Heart Disease Is the Number 1 Killer: Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death for women in the United States, killing 299,578 women in 2017 or 1 in every 5 female deaths. Since 2015, heart disease deaths rose by 1%, which was thought to be caused by the obesity epidemic. Yet, with heart attacks and strokes, these life-changing events that lead to disability and possibly death can be prevented. Most individuals who had a myocardial infarction were found to have at least 1 cardiovascular risk factor that was at a suboptimal level before their atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) event occurred.",
      "Pathophysiology: The exposure to 1 or more cardiovascular risk factors, such as elevated LDL cholesterol levels, and elevated blood pressure, can provoke injury to the surface of the endothelial arterial wall. The body responds to the injury with apolipoprotein B (apoB) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol particles, which then sparks the inflammatory response. This inflammatory response alerts the body to attract inflammatory markers of monocytes, macrophages, T cells, and activating blood clotting factors to the injured area. The inflammatory response enhances oxidative stress. This oxidation converts LDL into atherogenic particles which infiltrate the subendothelial space and produce the hallmark form of the fatty streak phase of atherosclerosis. In response to injury, the body decreases the production of nitric oxide, which causes the arteries to further constrict, significantly reducing the supply of oxygen-rich blood to the needed tissue.",
      "Cortisol levels increase in response to physical and emotional stress, causing vasoconstriction and subsequent increased blood pressure. When cortisol elevation is consistently elevated caused by a perceived stressful lifestyle, hyperglycemia and insulin resistance can occur and can subsequently contribute to an increased risk of visceral fat storage and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The deleterious effects of the chronically elevated cortisol level can lead to arterial vessel damage with subsequent plaque formation. This potentially deadly combination of plaque formation with vasoconstriction can increase the risk for a myocardial infarction. Individuals with rheumatoid arthritis and lupus are more susceptible to atherosclerotic disease due to their immune intensified inflammatory response and thereby are at a higher risk of developing atherosclerotic disease. This inflammatory response can weaken the fibrous cap on the arterial wall, causing it to rupture. Rupture leads to thrombus formation, which, depending on the location, may block the artery and lead to a heart attack, stroke, and sometimes death.",
      "Preventative Screening: With appropriate preventative screening and treatment, these statistics can be dramatically reduced. Utilizing early identification of individuals who are at risk, and implementing the use of primary, secondary, or tertiary prevention, health care providers (HCPs) could dramatically improve outcomes. Primary prevention starts by identifying individuals who are at risk, thereby preventing the disease or injury before it even occurs. By identifying these cardiovascular risks early, discussion and intervention can many times avert the path of danger and improve outcomes. When reflecting on our case study of M.T., what preventative strategies could have changed her outcome? Let’s turn back the clock to her first visit evaluation with the HCP and review the preventative strategies that could have changed her path to an improved outcome. Cardiovascular risks factors that should prompt further discussion with clients are provided in the Table.",
      "Cardiovascular Risks Factors That Should Prompt Further Discussion With Clients: Primary hyperlipidemia: With persistent elevated LDL-C > 160 mg/dl. Lipid biomarkers: Elevated lipoprotein a Lp(a), Lp(a) > 50 mg/dL or 125 nmol/L, Elevated ApoB, ApoB levels > 130. Metabolic syndrome is present when 3 or more of the following 5 criteria are met: Elevated triglycerides, Triglycerides (TG) > 150 mg/dL, Low HDL, Low HDL < 50 mg/dl for women, < HDL 40 mg/dl for men, Elevated blood pressure, BP > 130/80 mm Hg, Elevated Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) or diagnosis type 2 DM, FPG greater > 100 -125 mg/dl or diagnosis of type 2 DM >126 mg/dl or higher, Obesity BMI > 30 kg/m2, Increased waist circumference ≥ 40 inches (or > 102 cm) in men and ≥ 35 inches (> 88 cm) in women, Inflammatory marker, Persistent elevated high sensitivity C Reactive protein hs-CRP (> 2.0 mg/L), Chronic kidney disease, GFR 15-59 mL/min not treated with dialysis or kidney transplantation, Ethnicity, South Asian ancestry, Family history for premature coronary artery disease, Males < 55 y, females < 65 y. Lifestyle: Tobacco use, Increased age, Sedentary lifestyle, < 1.5 metabolic equivalents of activity, Women: Premature menopause, Menopause before age 40 y, Pregnancy-associated condition (e.g., preeclampsia or gestational diabetes), which predisposes cardiovascular risk later in life, Chronic inflammatory conditions: autoimmune disease, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, psoriasis, and human immunodeficiency virus infection.",
      "Preventative screening should start in the outpatient setting when the patient is asymptomatic. When screening asymptomatic adults 40 to 75 years old for ASCVD risks, the ASCVD Risk Estimator tool can facilitate decision-making about preventative interventions because the tool provides the predicted 10-year ASCVD risk. With today’s technology, there are multiple tools and applications that can be downloaded to the HCP’s computer and/or mobile phone for easy access. The ASCVD Risk Estimator Plus has a downloadable app and also can be found at https://www.acc.org/tools-and-practice-support/mobile-resources/features/2013-prevention-guidelines-ascvd-risk-estimator. The ASCVD Estimator Risk tool establishes a reference HCPs can use at the initial visit evaluating age, sex, race, lipid levels of total cholesterol, high-density lipoproteins (HDL), LDL, history of smoking, diabetes, treatment for hypertension, and if on statin and/or aspirin.",
      "When an individual assessed for ASCVD risk factors scores at either borderline or intermediate-risk categories, a coronary artery calcium (CAC) score test has been found to be a reliable tool of assessing the individual’s risk. The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis trial was the landmark trial; it validated that the CAC score improved risk prediction by showing the linear curve relationship between CAC progression and the risk of cardiovascular events and identified a 3- to 6-fold increase in the rate of events for those with a calcified plaque progression scoring ≥ 300 units. The CAC score test is a noninvasive computed tomographic scan to detect and quantify calcifications within the coronary arteries. It is used as a marker for the presence and extent of coronary atherosclerotic burden. An Agaston score is provided for the quantity of the of accumulated calcified plaque or no observation of calcified plaque which results in a zero score.",
      "In the absence of diabetes, tobacco/cigarette use, or a family history of premature coronary heart disease, a score of zero would identify an individual at a lower risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular events over a predicted 10-year period and would reclassify a patient in a lower risk category for which preventative intervention of statin therapy could possibly be withheld or delayed until future reassessment of a calcium score test in 5 to 10 years. The test does have limitations because it does not identify soft noncalcified plaque; therefore, clinical judgment of risk should prevail. Because soft noncalcified plaque tends to calcify over time, the sensitivity of the test does increase as the individual ages. The common cutoff points for the CAC score risk levels are 1 to 100, 101 to 300, and greater than 300. Karnib et al showed a very high CAC score (mean score = 1,222) was associated with significant adverse cardiovascular events. Even with the limitations of not detecting noncalcified plaque, the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) trial showed that the CAC score had superior risk reclassification compared with other imaging and biomarkers and, for this reason, is best used as secondary prevention after cardiovascular risks have been assessed.",
      "Using secondary prevention to detect plaque early, before plaque progression and associated adverse clinical outcomes, may reduce the impact of disease by detecting and then implementing treatment strategies as soon as possible with the goal of slowing or ideally halting plaque progression as soon as possible. The 2010 guidelines for risk stratification of asymptomatic adults raised the concern of radiation exposure and cost of the CAC tests; however, a subsequent study revealed the exposure of radiation is low. In the MESA study, the median radiation exposure was only 0.95 msv from the contemporary CT scanners, which was slightly more than the average mammogram. In addition, CAC test done once every 5-10 years further reduced radiation exposure. The 2018 task force report from the clinical practice guidelines for cholesterol management favored statin therapy if the CAC score is 1 to 99, especially for clients ≥ 55 years of age.",
      "When comparing the same CAC score of women versus men, women had a higher risk of cardiovascular events. For an Agatston CAC score ≥ 100 or ≥ 75th percentile, statin therapy is indicated unless otherwise deferred by the outcome of the HCP-client benefit versus risk discussion. In addition to lifestyle modifications, statin therapy continues to be the first-line therapy due to its beneficial effects of reducing the coronary artery plaque burden. Because the ASCVD risk estimator scored at borderline risk, M.T. had a CAC test that revealed a score of 132, calcified plaque was identified, and statin therapy was recommended to a targeted goal of LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) < 100, LDL particle number < 1000, non–HDL cholesterol < 130, and apolipoprotein B < 100. More aggressive targets of LDL-C < 70 are used for those at high ASCVD risk.",
      "Clients who are considered high-risk for ASCVD are identified by either multiple major ASCVD events, 1 ASCVD event with comorbidities, or a CAC Agatston score > 300. In these situations, the guidelines recommend maximizing statin therapy to target the low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) with a 50% reduction or goal of ≤ 70 mg/dl for maximized ASCVD risk reduction benefit. This is supported by the Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention: an Intervention (JUPITER) Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin, which achieved greater reductions in ASCVD outcomes with those who had greater reductions in LDL-C. After maximizing the statin dosage, if reassessment lipid levels show a need for further Low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol reduction to obtain the targeted goal, then adjunct therapy, such as ezetimibe, can provide a further LDL reduction.",
      "If a client is not able to achieve the targeted goal on statin therapy or does not tolerate statin therapy because of myalgias or other adverse side effects, another option is the PCSK9 inhibitor. However, PCSK9 inhibitors are presently given to higher-risk patients because of the required injections, association with an increased cost, and the long-term safety (> 3 years) is still considered uncertain. Low-dose (75-100 mg) aspirin or (acetylsalicylic acid [ASA]) reduces the risk of atherothrombosis and continues to be favored in secondary prevention. In the present case study, low-dose ASA would be recommended for M.T. based on her risk factors and abnormal calcium score. ASA has become more controversial in primary prevention because of the increased risk of bleeding. Current guidelines recommend low-dose ASA to those between 40 and 70 years old who are considered higher ASCVD risk but who are not at increased risk of bleeding.",
      "Low-dose ASA should not be routinely administered for prophylactic use in the primary prevention of ASCVD risk in adults > 70 years old because of the increased risk of bleeding. Lifestyle Intervention: The 2018 task force report from the cholesterol clinical practice guidelines also recommends emphasizing healthy lifestyle interventions through diet and exercise to treat or minimize the risk of metabolic syndrome. Emphasizing healthy lifestyle interventions through diet and exercise is paramount. Accordingly, it is important to address the following during each office visit: cigarette smoking, elevated blood pressure, abnormal serum glucose and lipid markers, increased BMI, and/or increased waist circumference.",
      "There is overwhelming evidence that the occurrence of ASCVD can be reduced by approximately 80% if prophylactic lifestyle modifications occur. Multiple studies have observed the association between increased cardiovascular disease and mortality and a change in dietary habits. The obesity epidemic that contributes to cardiovascular disease and mortality is fueled by a dietary pattern including increased consumption of sugar, sweetened beverages, refined grains, trans fats/partially hydrogenated oils, and processed animal meats (e.g., bacon, salami, and hotdogs). This dietary pattern of increased sugar consumption with refined grains correlated with the development of obesity and type 2 diabetes incurred an increased risk of ASCVD by 20%. In addition, daily consumption of > 10% added sugar was associated with an increased mortality rate.",
      "Trans fats/partially hydrogenated oils were also associated with higher risk because of their adverse effects on the lipoproteins that promote inflammation, insulin resistance, and subsequent endothelial dysfunction. It is important to replace trans fats/partially hydrogenated oils with an alternative such as beneficial monounsaturated or polyunsaturated fats; this replacement led to a reduced risk of ASCVD. For adult clients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, lifestyle intervention through improved dietary habits and physical exercise is critical. If drug therapy is needed, metformin should be considered for first-line therapy. In accordance with the current 2019 guidelines, metformin provides improved glycemic control in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease.",
      "Adults diagnosed with an increased BMI (overweight BMI > 25 and obesity BMI > 30) have an increased risk of hypertension, ASCVD, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation compared with normal BMI adults. Adults with higher BMI and subsequent cardiometabolic risk are candidates for measurement of the waist circumference and waist-to-hip ratio. Caution should be provided when measuring BMI in muscular or elderly clients because of possible skewed results stemming from changes in muscle composition. Central adiposity has been found through measurement of the waist circumference ≥ 40 inches (or > 102 cm) in men, and ≥ 35 inches (> 88 cm) in women has been associated with increased ASCVD risk. An increased BMI provokes an added risk for the development of hypertension. The DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet, shown through trials of hypertension prevention, that a change in dietary habits with sodium reduction and potassium-enhanced foods have a beneficiary effect of lowering blood pressure and cardiovascular events.",
      "Recent guidelines for clients with an increased BMI > 25 and hypertension recommend limiting alcohol, and a weight-reducing diet with increased physical activity should be promoted targeting blood pressure in adults to < 130/80. Changes in the recommended dietary guidelines over the past decade have caused considerable confusion. The most recent recommendation associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality is the Mediterranean diet. This recommendation is based on the consensus of evidence-based studies that suggest a diet composed predominantly of vegetables and fruits with the inherent soluble and insoluble fiber, plant-based proteins of nuts and legumes, lean-based protein (preferably fish because of its rich anti-inflammatory omega 3 oils), and extra-virgin olive oil. The Adventist Health Study2 cohort reported a pro-vegetarian diet composed predominantly of vegetables and plant-based protein in place of meat provided a 40% reduction in mortality.",
      "Consuming a plant-based or Mediterranean diet and avoiding the damaging inflammatory trans fats/hydrogenated oils, sugar, sweeteners, refined grains, and processed red meats have been shown to decrease the inflammatory response and reverse obesity, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and hypertension. Regular physical activity has numerous health benefits. It improves insulin sensitivity, enhances detoxification, reduces stress, reduces risk for chronic disease, and is the cornerstone of maintaining cardiovascular health. Yet, approximately half of the adults within the US do not meet the minimum recommended guideline. The average US adult spends 7 hours per day in sedentary activities, not including hours of sleep.",
      "There is a strong inverse relationship between the amount of moderate to vigorous physical activity and the incidence of ASCVD events. This inverse relationship evidences significant benefits for those who engage in moderate to vigorous exercise. Current guidelines for achievement of the lower ASCVD risk benefit call for adults to engage in either a minimum of 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity exercise. Adults who achieved a higher level of physical activity (> 300 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise or 150 minutes of vigorous aerobic intensity) received an additional reduction in ASCVD risk. Adults who led a sedentary lifestyle, defined as less than 1.5 metabolic equivalents of activity, associated with sitting, reclining, or watching television encountered an increased ASCVD risk.",
      "Physical activity can be used from primary to tertiary prevention. Physical activity through tertiary prevention of a cardiac rehabilitation program strengthens the ability of the heart to function and improves quality and life expectancy. Adults who engaged in physical activity had a lower risk of mortality the first year post–myocardial infarction over a 4.2-year follow-up. Conclusion: Globally, ASCVD remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality and has been attributed to suboptimal implementation of preventative strategies that address a client’s uncontrolled ASCVD risk factors. Prevention strategies need to promote a healthy lifestyle that optimizes a healthy anti-inflammatory diet, promotes physical activity and stress reduction, and avoids first- or second-hand tobacco exposure to minimize the risk of disease or halt the disease progression.",
      "Early intervention with the lipid and serum biomarkers using imaging tests like the CAC score will enable early detection before symptoms arise. Such early detection should allow clients to receive preventative treatment for early stages of coronary artery disease that might otherwise have gone untreated and potentially culminated in a cardiovascular event. Lifestyle and pharmacotherapy intervention for blood pressure reduction, lipid lowering, and glucose control could be added to optimize treatments required to reach target goals recommended by evidence-based guidelines. Subjecting our case scenario client M.T. to risk stratification and preventative lifestyle and pharmacologic interventions that target inflammation will likely provide an optimal outcome and avert a devastating life-changing cardiovascular event."

      "Continuing Education Activity: Cerebral ischemia is a common mechanism of acute brain injury that results from impaired blood flow to the brain. Cerebral ischemia represents a medical emergency; if untreated, it can result in cerebral infarctions or global hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, which can result in death or permanent disability. This activity reviews the etiology, epidemiology, pathophysiology, evaluation, and treatment of cerebral ischemia and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition. Objectives: Identify the etiology of cerebral ischemia. Describe the appropriate evaluation for a patient with suspected cerebral ischemia. Summarize the management options available for cerebral ischemia. Access free multiple choice questions on this topic.",
      "Introduction: The human brain is a highly metabolically active organ, accounting for about 25% of a person's metabolic demand, despite comprising only 2.5% of a typical individual's body weight. Consequently, the brain is exquisitely sensitive to disruptions in blood flow. Complex homeostatic mechanisms act to maintain cerebral blood flow at a relatively stable rate of about 50 ml/100g of brain tissue per minute, through a process known as cerebrovascular autoregulation. When this blood flow is compromised, the result is cerebral ischemia, one of the most common mechanisms of brain dysfunction and damage. The extent of neuronal injury resulting from compromised cerebral perfusion depends upon both the extent and duration of the hypoperfusion.",
      "Etiology: Cerebral ischemia can be global or focal. Global cerebral ischemia is a result of systemic processes, often shock. The most common cause of global brain ischemia is systemic hypotension. Transient cerebral hypoperfusion can occur when autonomic and neurohormonal mechanisms that control blood pressure and heart rate are disrupted, as in vasovagal syncope and postural tachycardia syndromes. Structural and functional heart problems, mostly arrhythmias, are the second most frequent cause of transient global brain ischemia. When the effect is transient, the condition often manifests as a presyncope or syncope. Prolonged global ischemia, on the other hand, can result in permanent neurological injury.",
      "In contrast, focal brain ischemia most commonly arises from obstruction of arterial blood flow to the brain, often as a result of thrombosis or embolism. If the ischemia persists long enough, irreversible neuronal loss occurs, resulting in an ischemic stroke. Sudden thrombosis of a previously stenotic cerebral or internal carotid artery ruptured plaque will lead to ischemia in the region supplied by the artery affected. Embolization of a clot formed in the heart or a large artery is the most common source of brain ischemia, accounting for almost 60% to 70% of brain TIA and stroke cases. Emboli of other material, such as fat, air from an iatrogenic cause, or amniotic fluid during pregnancy, are possible but much less frequent.",
      "There are various additional rare causes of ischemia. Dissection of cervical blood vessels can rarely cause brain ischemia and may be a cause of stroke in younger patients. Vasospasm is a relatively uncommon secondary cause of brain ischemia. This can be provoked by medication, or it can be secondary to trauma, inflammation, or recent subarachnoid hemorrhage. Rarely, an infection can lead to strokes. Notably, an increased incidence of stroke has occurred with COVID-19. One simple method of classification of causes for brain ischemia and ischemic stroke is the TOAST criteria. This divides ischemic stroke etiology into the categories of large artery disease (usually secondary to atherosclerosis, occlusive), cardioembolic (cardiac causes such as atrial fibrillation, valvular abnormalities, or abnormalities in cardiac wall motion), small vessel occlusive disease (affects small perforating arteries, often secondary to underlying hypertension), a stroke of other etiology (known etiology of the stroke such as vasculitis or drug use), or stroke of unknown etiology (also called a cryptogenic stroke, no cause found after medical workup).",
      "Epidemiology: Stroke is one of the most prevalent vascular diseases in the world and persistently ranks as the 5th leading cause of death in the United States. The 2019 AHA report on heart disease and stroke statistics estimates that 20 million Americans greater than 20 years of age have had a stroke. Approximately 795,000 people have a stroke each year. Prevalence increases with age, with nearly 75% of cases affecting people over the age of 65. Strokes prevalence is greater among African Americans and Hispanic people than Caucasians. The prevalence of stroke is approximately the same in both females and males, with a slight female predominance as prevalence decreased in males over the past 15 years.",
      "Stroke is a broad term that encompasses neurological injury resulting from any vascular cause. Ischemic stroke is the most common type, making up 87% of all strokes. They are caused by acute ischemia of an area of the brain supplied by one artery (focal ischemia) and is one major cause of disability and death in the US and the world. Syncope, the consequence of temporary ischemia to the entire brain (global ischemia), is one of the most common “symptoms” in all populations. So, brain ischemia is one of the most common causes of disability in the world. Pathophysiology: Brain ischemia in its broad sense can be focal or multifocal, caused by a sudden closure or marked diameter reduction of the artery supplying an area of the brain, be it of previously stenotic or normal arteries (i.e. aorta, supra-aortic trunk or intracranial arteries).",
      "Brain ischemia can frequently be triggered through the lack of global brain blood supply, in more proximal causes of hemodynamic dysfunction causing sudden blood pressure fall. Ischemic brain tissue stops working in seconds and suffers necrosis in as soon as 5 minutes after complete lack of oxygen and glucose supply, compared to 20-40 minutes in other parts of the body. Some areas are particularly susceptible to ischemia, a phenomenon known as selective vulnerability. These areas include the arterial border zones, pyramidal cells in the hippocampal CA1 area, and cerebellar Purkinje cells. Arterial border zones are also known as watershed areas; one common location is the superior cerebral convexity which is the area between the territories of the anterior and middle cerebral arteries, which is highly susceptible to decreased cerebral perfusion pressure.",
      "The reason for the selective vulnerability of specific neuron types is not completely understood but is believed to be due to variations in the expression of excitatory glutamate neurotransmitter receptors on neurons. The persistent complications of brain ischemia are due to permanent brain damage and are a final common pathway to necrosis: neuronal shrinkage and death, gliosis with astrocytosis, and loss of volume. Neuronal sensitivity to ischemia is multifactorial: the brain has a high basal metabolic rate and high cell-cell signaling activates pathways such as glutamate-induced neuronal death, dopamine-induced potentiation of ischemic injury, free radical release, zinc toxicity, and release of enzymes leading to combination apoptosis and catabolic necrosis.",
      "Histopathology: In global ischemic injury, histologic changes become apparent within 12 to 24 hours of injury. The first changes seen are shrinking or swelling of neurons. After that, \"red neurons\" may develop as a consequence of cytoplasmic eosinophilia, nuclear pyknosis, and other necrotic changes. Other findings of edema may also become apparent, such as empty areas within the parenchyma with widened pericellular and perivascular spaces. Grossly, this may appear as irregular zones of discoloration with a blurring of the zones between gray and white matter. Over time, this evolves into the loss of neurons and gliosis. While most parts of the body affected by ischemia undergo coagulative necrosis, the brain is unique in that it undergoes liquefactive necrosis. This appears as viscous material containing numerous inflammatory cells such as neutrophils and cell debris under a microscope.",
      "History and Physical: The most important part of the evaluation of any patient with neurological symptoms is the history of the presenting complaint. Cerebral ischemia results in negative symptoms related to loss of function of the ischemic tissue. Global cerebral ischemia typically presents as an alteration in consciousness. Transient alteration in consciousness, such as syncope or pre-syncope, may be precipitated by maneuvers such as standing, which may result in a drop in cerebral perfusion pressure. Often the symptoms are relieved by lowering the patient's head. Severe or persistent global cerebral ischemia may result in a patient who presents with a coma. The symptoms of focal cerebral ischemia will depend upon the specific portions of the brain, which are ischemic.",
      "The time of onset and the time course of the presenting complaint is important to ascertain because this can have a significant impact on treatment decisions. Determining the time of symptom onset is ideal, but this may not be possible. In cases where the precise onset cannot be determined, clinical decision-making is determined by the last known time that the patient was normal. Skilled clinicians learn to recognize specific stroke syndromes, which are patterns of neurological dysfunction related to blockages in particular blood vessels. For example, lesions in the cerebral hemispheres may result in contralateral weakness and/or sensory loss. Signs of cortical dysfunction raise the concern for a large artery obstruction, such as a middle cerebral artery occlusion.",
      "Cortical dysfunction in the dominant hemisphere--typically the left--often results in aphasia. Nondominant cortical dysfunction typically presents hemineglect, though this can also be seen with dominant hemisphere infarctions. Other potential signs of cortical involvement may include visual field defects, acalculia, and hemiagnosia. Strokes related to posterior circulation pathology, e.g., the vertebrobasilar system, may present with ataxia, diplopia or ophthalmoparesis, or crossed findings. Early recognition of stroke syndromes consistent with large vessel occlusion is critical because these patients may be candidates for endovascular thrombectomy. In addition to eliciting determining the time of symptom onset, a focused medical history should be obtained. The presence of vascular risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, hyperlipidemia, and tobacco abuse should be ascertained, as this information could provide clues as to the stroke etiology. A current medication list is also important because intravenous thrombolytics, which are often used to treat ischemic stroke, are contraindicated in patients taking anticoagulants.",
      "The physical assessment should be focused on identifying the signs of neurological dysfunction in order to identify the location of the brain lesion. One tool commonly used by physicians to assess strokes is the NIH Stroke Scale. This screening examination allows a rapid assessment of the patient's level of consciousness, oculomotor function, visual fields, motor function, sensation, cerebellar function, language, and attention or neglect. The exam findings are scored from 0 to 40, which facilitates communication between providers and allows monitoring for fluctuation of deficits over time. Evaluation: The initial workup of symptoms suggestive of cerebral ischemia should include basic labs, including blood glucose, complete blood count, chemistry, coagulation factors, EKG, and cardiac enzymes.",
      "A stat non-contrast head CT should be obtained to rule out a hemorrhage or mass lesion. Vascular imaging, such as a CT-angiogram or MR-angiogram, can be very valuable in the acute setting. Vascular imaging can help to identify the stroke etiology, especially in cases of large vessel atherosclerosis; in the case of acute large vessel occlusion, the site of the vascular obstruction may be evident. Often in the setting of an acute ischemic stroke, a non-contrast head CT may demonstrate no discernable abnormality, especially if the patient presents early in the course of the illness. In this case, MRI or CT perfusion may be valuable in order to determine the viability of the ischemic tissue.",
      "Because the fate of ischemic neuronal tissue depends upon both the extent and duration of ischemia, patients presenting with acute focal cerebral ischemia often have a region of infarcted brain tissue (the core infarct) surrounded by a larger area of the ischemic brain which may still be viable. This potentially viable region is known as the penumbra. There has been extensive research in the last decade regarding neuroimaging modalities for determining the volume of ischemic penumbra. Although a thorough analysis of acute stroke imaging techniques is beyond the scope of this article, it is important to recognize that patients with suspected large vessel occlusions may benefit from advanced imaging to determine candidacy for endovascular interventions.",
      "If a patient presents with symptoms of large vessel occlusion, including signs of cerebrocortical ischemia, transfer to a comprehensive stroke center or thrombectomy-capable stroke center should be considered. Treatment/Management: The management of global brain ischemia is generally targeted at correcting the underlying cause. Supportive care should be undertaken to ensure adequate cerebral blood flow; this may be facilitated by placing the patient flat or in the Trendelenburg position while other supportive measures are being taken. In the case of acute ischemic stroke, the first priority is determining whether the patient is a candidate for acute reperfusion therapy. Intravenous thrombolytics have been in use for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke for more than 25 years.",
      "Tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) is currently the only thrombolytic agent approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the management of acute ischemic stroke, though studies into the efficacy of tenecteplase are underway. TPA is approved for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke if it can be administered within 3 hours of symptom onset; however, studies indicate that it may be safe and effective if given as much as 4.5 hours after the development of symptoms. For patients with acute ischemic stroke due to occlusion of a large vessel, mechanical thrombectomy may be indicated. As discussed above, determining whether a patient is a candidate for thrombectomy relies on the time of symptom onset, the severity of the patient's deficits, the location of the large vessel occlusion, and the viability of the ischemic tissue.",
      "Patients with suspected large vessel occlusion should be transferred to a comprehensive stroke center or thrombectomy-capable center as soon as feasible. However, the decision to transfer the patient should not delay or preclude treatment with thrombolytics if the patient also meets the criteria for TPA. Outside of the acute period, the treatment of ischemic stroke is focused on secondary prevention and promoting recovery. A thorough medical history is necessary to evaluate stroke risk factors, including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, tobacco use, hyperlipidemia, and atrial fibrillation. Management of risk factors should be optimized in order to minimize the risk of recurrent stroke.",
      "For most stroke survivors, antiplatelet agents, such as aspirin or clopidogrel, are indicated for secondary stroke prevention. In some stroke subtypes, a short course of dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin as well as clopidogrel may decrease the risk of early recurrence. In addition, high-intensity statin therapy has been shown to be beneficial. For stroke related to atrial fibrillation, anticoagulation is indicated; factor Xa inhibitors are preferred over warfarin due to improved safety profiles. Patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis, e.g., hemodynamically significant stenosis of the carotid artery ipsilateral to a stroke or transient ischemic attack, should be evaluated for carotid endarterectomy or stenting.",
      "For all stroke survivors, smoking cessation, maintenance of ideal body weight, and regular exercise should be encouraged. In fact, there is evidence that lifestyle modifications provide more benefit than stroke prevention medications. In order to promote optimal recovery, patients with acute stroke should be cared for within interdisciplinary teams, including occupational and physical therapists and speech-language pathologists. Differential Diagnosis: The differential diagnosis for ischemic stroke-like symptoms includes hypoglycemia, electrolyte imbalances such as hyponatremia, drug use, infections including meningitis, cardiogenic syncope, TIA, vasculitis, migraine, tumor, cerebral hemorrhage, and seizures.",
      "Prognosis: Depending upon the duration of brain ischemia, there may be mild brain dysfunction, prolonged dysfunction with permanent damage to the brain, with or without permanent symptoms and disability. Patient outcomes after cerebral ischemia can range from no permanent effects (transient ischemic attack) to permanent disability to death. The severity of impairment is linked to the patient's functional status before the ischemic event. For example, patients with mild cognitive impairment or dementia had greater relative cognitive impairment after ischemic stroke, suggestive of lower neuronal tolerance of ischemia. It is also linked to patient age.",
      "Complications: While prompt reperfusion after ischemia/infarction is essential for preserving neurological function, it can precipitate tissue dysfunction and cell necrosis from the destruction of reversibly damaged cells. Cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury can occur after thrombolysis or mechanical thrombectomy. While this restores brain flow and salvages reversibly damaged tissue, reperfusion after a longer ischemic period can cause a larger infarct than the initial occlusion. The mechanism of this injury involves leukocyte infiltration, platelet activation, complement activation, and breakdown of the blood-brain barrier leading to vasogenic ischemia. Conversion to hemorrhagic stroke after tPA is another complication. It should be seriously considered if the patient's condition worsens after thrombolytic administrations.",
      "Symptoms can include a change in awareness or consciousness, worsening neurologic exam, increased weakness, new or worsening headache, or changes in blood pressure or pulse. If this happens, the first step should be immediate Head CT, baseline labs, and neurosurgery consult. Patients with acute ischemic stroke are also at risk for complications of immobility, including infections and thromboembolic complications. Due to the risk of aspiration, patients should receive a swallow screen prior to being offered food or drink by mouth. Care should be taken to minimize infection by using aspiration precautions and minimizing the use of invasive devices such as urinary catheters. Additionally, mechanical deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis (DVT) should be employed whenever possible.",
      "Pharmacological DVT prophylaxis should also be considered, though this is contraindicated within 24 hours of TPA administration and may be contraindicated for patients with a hemorrhagic conversion. Deterrence and Patient Education: Risk factors for cerebral ischemia include heart disease, including heart conditions such as atrial fibrillation, diabetes, obesity, hypertension, atherosclerosis/hyperlipidemia, and history of strokes. Behavioral risk factors include physical inactivity, poor sleep, obesity, excessive alcohol intake, and tobacco use. Sickle cell disease and other hematologic disorders, especially hypercoagulable conditions, can also increase the risk of ischemic stroke. Minimizing risk for stroke involves treating these conditions with a healthy diet, exercise, and medication adherence. In particular, statins and blood thinners have been proven to reduce the risk of ischemic stroke.",
      "Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes: Stroke patients require care in multidisciplinary teams in order to optimize outcomes. The need for interdisciplinary care begins in the prehospital setting because of early recognition, and prompt treatment of ischemic stroke symptoms is critical. Emergency medical providers are instrumental in early diagnosis, and systems of care are increasingly being organized to route patients to stroke-ready hospitals. In some areas, mobile stroke units are being employed to facilitate triage and early stroke treatment. Upon arrival in the emergency department, implementation to promote rapid evaluation and facilitate thrombolytic administration have been shown to improve patient outcomes.",
      "After acute treatment decisions have been made, admission to dedicated stroke units has demonstrated improved outcomes. These units ideally incorporate trained nursing staff as well as rehabilitation providers such as physical therapists, occupational therapists, and speech-language pathologists. Organized stroke units allow early detection of potential complications and facilitate rehabilitation care, which reduces mortality and has a durable effect on patient disability."

    "title": "Hypoxic-ischemic brain injury: Pathophysiology, neuropathology and mechanisms",
    "content": [
      "Abstract: Hypoxic-ischemic brain injury is a well-known consequence of cardiac arrest. Variable injuries can occur with purely hypoxic or histotoxic insults such as asphyxiation and carbon monoxide poisoning. The injury may happen at the time of the insult, but there may also be continued damage after circulation and oxygenation are reestablished. Pathophysiology: The microscopic mechanisms for tissue injury during the interruption of circulation are manifold. Early changes in global ischemia consist of anoxic depolarizations, leading to changes in the intra- and extracellular electrolyte composition, and a fall in ATP.",
      "Anoxic depolarization is one of the main events observed in an anoxic-ischemic insult in vivo. Between 60 and 180 seconds after the onset of global ischemia, a large negative direct-current shift occurs in both neuropil and cell body regions of the ischemic tissue. Due to impaired cell membrane function, extracellular sodium, chloride, and calcium decrease, and potassium leaks into the extracellular space. Biochemical Changes: High energy phosphates (i.e., ATP) drop to their lowest values within one to two minutes, and lactic acid and hydrogen ions (H+) are released into the local environment. Acidosis abounds on a local level: the extracellular space begins to become acidic within 20 seconds of the ischemic or anoxic insult, and the intracellular pH follows and reaches a minimal value after two minutes.",
      "Functional Changes of the Cell: Mitochondrial damage occurs early after the intracellular calcium accumulation. Transient mitochondrial swelling can be observed, along with disaggregation of polyribosomes, and abnormal Golgi complexes. The mitochondrial dysfunction causes a further lack of ATP repletion, overproduction of free radicals, and increasing inability of the cell to buffer the calcium loads. Neuronal Cell Death: Pathological studies have provided evidence for different types of neuronal cell death after an ischemic insult. Ischemic cell damage can culminate in primary necrotic cell death if the revival time of the brain is exceeded by the ischemic event. The second important mechanism of cell death after hypoxic-ischemic insults is apoptosis. Another form of cell death in ischemia is free radical-induced damage and autophagocytosis.",
      "Conclusion: In survivors of cardiac arrest or hypoxic insults, neurological injury is a common problem. The mechanisms of injury, as well as the prognosis, are not the same for different types of insults. Prolonged periods of hypoperfusion and ischemia are associated with worse outcomes, while isolated respiratory arrest with pure hypoxia often carries a better prognosis for recovery. This key text can be embedded and stored in a vector database for similarity search as part of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. The extracted sections cover essential aspects of hypoxic-ischemic brain injury and can be useful for queries related to the pathophysiology, biochemical changes, functional changes, and neuronal cell death mechanisms."

This means the force of blood against your artery walls is too strong. It means your heart is working hard to move blood. High blood pressure usually has no symptoms. But over time, it can cause serious health problems. High blood pressure raises your risk for these problems: Heart attack Stroke Heart disease Heart failure Kidney disease Vision loss With help from your healthcare provider, you can manage your blood pressure and protect your health.",
      "Blood pressure measurements are given as 2 numbers. Systolic blood pressure is the upper number. This is the pressure when the heart contracts or pumps. Diastolic blood pressure is the lower number. This is the pressure when the heart relaxes between beats.",
      "Blood pressure is grouped like this: Normal blood pressure. This is systolic of less than 120 and diastolic of less than 80 (120/80) at rest Elevated blood pressure. This is systolic of 120 to 129 and diastolic less than 80 at rest Stage 1 high blood pressure. This is systolic is 130 to 139 or diastolic between 80 to 89 at rest Stage 2 high blood pressure. This is when systolic is 140 or higher or the diastolic is 90 or higher at rest",
      "Taking medicine Learn to measure your own blood pressure. Keep a record of your results. Ask your healthcare provider what numbers mean that you need medical care. Take your blood pressure medicine exactly as directed. Don’t skip doses. Missing doses can cause your blood pressure to get out of control. Ask your healthcare provider what to do if you miss a dose. Don't take medicines that contain heart stimulants. This includes over-the-counter medicines. Check for warnings about high blood pressure on the label. Ask the pharmacist before buying a medicine you haven't used before. Check with your healthcare provider before taking a decongestant. This includes medicines with pseudoephedrine or phenylephrine on the label. Ask the pharmacist if you are not sure. These can make high blood pressure worse. If you take medicine to have sex, talk to your healthcare provider. Taking these medicines with a type of blood pressure medicine called nitrates can be dangerous. This can drop your blood pressure too low.",
      "Lifestyle changes Keep a healthy weight. Get help to lose any extra pounds. Meeting with a dietitian can help you make diet changes to help with weight loss. Cut back on salt. To do this: Limit canned, dried, packaged, and fast foods. Don’t add salt to your food at the table. Season foods with herbs instead of salt when you cook. Ask for no added salt when you eat out. Have no more than 1,500 mg a day of sodium. You can make a positive change by cutting back to even 2,300 mg of sodium a day. Read all food labels to see how much sodium they have. Follow the DASH eating plan. DASH stands for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension. This plan advises a way to eat for healthy blood pressure. The diet includes vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and other healthy foods. Eat food rich in potassium. Begin an exercise program. Talk with your healthcare provider before you get started. Work up to aerobic exercise 3 to 4 times a week for an average of 40 minutes at a time to lower blood pressure. Even simple activities can help blood pressure. These include walking or gardening.",

      "What is hypertension? Hypertension is high blood pressure. Your blood pressure is the force of your blood moving against the walls of your arteries. Hypertension causes your blood pressure to get so high that your heart has to work much harder than normal. This can damage your heart. Hypertension that does not respond to medicines and lifestyle changes is called resistant hypertension. Hypertension is considered chronic when it continues for 3 months or longer.",
      "What do I need to know about the stages of hypertension? Your healthcare provider will give you a blood pressure goal based on your age, health, and risk for cardiovascular disease. The following are general guidelines on the stages of hypertension: Normal blood pressure is 119/79 or lower. Your healthcare provider may only check your blood pressure each year if it stays at a normal level. Elevated blood pressure is 120/79 to 129/79. This is sometimes called prehypertension. Your healthcare provider may suggest lifestyle changes to help lower your blood pressure to a normal level. He or she may then check it again in 3 to 6 months. Stage 1 hypertension is 130/80 to 139/89. Your provider may recommend lifestyle changes, medication, and checks every 3 to 6 months until your blood pressure is controlled. Stage 2 hypertension is 140/90 or higher. Your provider will recommend lifestyle changes and have you take 2 kinds of hypertension medicines. You will also need to have your blood pressure checked monthly until it is controlled.",
      "Blood Pressure Readings What increases my risk for hypertension? The cause of hypertension may not be known. This is called essential or primary hypertension. Hypertension caused by another medical condition, such as kidney disease, is called secondary hypertension. Any of the following can increase your risk: Age older than 55 years (men) or 65 (women) Stress, or a family history of hypertension or heart disease Obesity, lack of exercise, or too many high-sodium foods Use of tobacco, alcohol, or illegal drugs A medical condition, such as diabetes, kidney disease, thyroid disease, or adrenal gland disorder Certain medicines, such as steroids or birth control pills",
      "What are the signs and symptoms of hypertension? You may have no signs or symptoms, or you may have any of the following: Headache Blurred vision Chest pain Dizziness or weakness Trouble breathing Nosebleeds",
      "How is hypertension diagnosed? Your healthcare provider will take your blood pressure at several visits. You may also need to check your blood pressure at home. The provider will examine you and ask about medicines you take. He or she will also ask if you have a family history of high blood pressure and about any health conditions you have. He or she will also check your blood pressure and weight and examine your heart, lungs, and eyes. You may need any of the following tests: An ambulatory blood pressure monitor (ABPM) is a device that you wear. ABPM measures your blood pressure while you do your regular daily activities. It records your blood pressure every 15 to 30 minutes during the day. It also records your blood pressure every 15 minutes to 1 hour at night. The recorded blood pressures help your healthcare provider know if you have hypertension not seen at your appointment. Blood tests may help healthcare providers find the cause of your hypertension. Blood tests can also help find other health problems caused by hypertension. Urine tests will be done to check your kidney function. Kidney problems can increase your risk for hypertension.",
      "Which medicines are used to treat hypertension? Antihypertensives may be used to help lower your blood pressure. Several kinds of medicines are available. Your healthcare provider will choose medicines based on the kind of hypertension you have. You may need more than one type of medicine. Take the medicine exactly as directed. Diuretics help decrease extra fluid that collects in your body. This will help lower your blood pressure. You may urinate more often while you take this medicine. Cholesterol medicine helps lower your cholesterol level. A low cholesterol level helps prevent heart disease and makes it easier to control your blood pressure.",
      "What can I do to manage hypertension? Check your blood pressure at home. Do not smoke, have caffeine, or exercise for at least 30 minutes before you check your blood pressure. Sit and rest for 5 minutes before you check your blood pressure. Extend your arm and support it on a flat surface. Your arm should be at the same level as your heart. Follow the directions that came with your blood pressure monitor. Check your blood pressure 2 times, 1 minute apart, before you take your medicine in the morning. Also check your blood pressure before your evening meal. Keep a record of your readings and bring it to your follow-up visits. Ask your healthcare provider what your blood pressure should be.",
      "How to take a Blood Pressure Manage any other health conditions you have. Health conditions such as diabetes can increase your risk for hypertension. Follow your healthcare provider's instructions and take all your medicines as directed. Ask about all medicines. Certain medicines can increase your blood pressure. Examples include oral birth control pills, decongestants, herbal supplements, and NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen. Your healthcare provider can tell you which medicines are safe for you to take. This includes prescription and over-the-counter medicines.",
      "What lifestyle changes can I make to manage hypertension? Your healthcare provider may recommend you work with a team to manage hypertension. The team may include medical experts such as a dietitian, an exercise or physical therapist, and a behavior therapist. Your family members may be included in helping you create lifestyle changes. Ways to Lower Your Blood Pressure Limit sodium (salt) as directed. Too much sodium can affect your fluid balance. Check labels to find low-sodium or no-salt-added foods. Some low-sodium foods use potassium salts for flavor. Too much potassium can also cause health problems. Your healthcare provider will tell you how much sodium and potassium are safe for you to have in a day. He or she may recommend that you limit sodium to 2,300 mg a day.",
      "Follow the meal plan recommended by your healthcare provider. A dietitian or your provider can give you more information on low-sodium plans or the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) eating plan. The DASH plan is low in sodium, processed sugar, unhealthy fats, and total fat. It is high in potassium, calcium, and fiber. These can be found in vegetables, fruit, and whole-grain foods. Be physically active throughout the day. Physical activity, such as exercise, can help control your blood pressure and your weight. Be physically active for at least 30 minutes per day, on most days of the week. Include aerobic activity, such as walking or riding a bicycle. Also include strength training at least 2 times each week. Your healthcare providers can help you create a physical activity plan. Ways to Be Physically Active Strength Training for Adults Decrease stress. This may help lower your blood pressure. Learn ways to relax, such as deep breathing or listening to music.",
      "Limit alcohol as directed. Alcohol can increase your blood pressure. A drink of alcohol is 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine, or 1½ ounces of liquor. Do not smoke. Nicotine and other chemicals in cigarettes and cigars can increase your blood pressure and also cause lung damage. Ask your healthcare provider for information if you currently smoke and need help to quit. E-cigarettes or smokeless tobacco still contain nicotine. Talk to your healthcare provider before you use these products.",
      "Prevent Heart Disease Call your local emergency number (911 in the US) or have someone call if: You have chest pain. You have any of the following signs of a heart attack: Squeezing, pressure, or pain in your chest You may also have any of the following: Discomfort or pain in your back, neck, jaw, stomach, or arm Shortness of breath Nausea or vomiting Lightheadedness or a sudden cold sweat You become confused or have trouble speaking.

Conclusion: Path type early rehabilitation nursing positively impacts neurological recovery in cerebral infarction patients and is recommended for broader application. Keywords: Early path rehabilitation nursing, cerebral infarction, neurological function.",
      "Introduction: Cerebral infarction, caused by the sudden cessation of blood flow in a brain artery, leads to ischemia, hypoxia, and brain tissue necrosis, resulting in neurological deficits such as hemiplegia and aphasia. It imposes significant mental, material, and economic burdens on patients and society. Despite advancements in medical science reducing mortality, many survivors experience dysfunctions impacting their quality of life.",
      "Rehabilitation nursing aims to prevent and treat these dysfunctions. Early rehabilitation nursing based on clinical pathways has shown promise in improving patient outcomes through structured, individualized care plans that enhance patient compliance and rehabilitation effects. Related Work: Rehabilitation training, based on brain plasticity, helps recover lost functions by stimulating damaged areas. Studies indicate early rehabilitation promotes neurological activity, increases cerebral cortex thickness, and fosters new blood vessel formation.",
      "Early rehabilitation can also regulate inflammatory factors, aiding in neurological function recovery. Research highlights the time-sensitive nature of rehabilitation, with early intervention leading to better cortical reorganization and motor function recovery. Continuous rehabilitation care in China is progressing, though more research on path type early rehabilitation nursing's effectiveness is needed. Information and Methods: 112 cerebral infarction patients were divided into control and experimental groups.",
      "Both groups received routine care. The experimental group also received path type early rehabilitation nursing, involving structured rehabilitation exercises starting within 24 hours of admission. NIHSS was used to evaluate neurological function at admission, and 2 and 12 weeks post-intervention. Data were analyzed using SPSS18.0, with statistical significance set at P<0.05. Result and Discussion: NIHSS scores pre and post-intervention. The experimental group had significantly lower scores, indicating better neurological recovery.",
      "Early rehabilitation nursing increased cerebral blood flow, established collateral circulation, and reduced inflammation, aiding recovery. Conclusion: Early rehabilitation nursing improves neurological function and daily living activities in cerebral infarction patients, making it a valuable clinical practice. Further improvements in study design are needed to address confounding factors."
